     * Below method will dump of files which causes some inconsistence. The inconsistency
     * means that a library has minified and corresponding regular files but not
     * all minified files have these regular files. Most the these inconsisntencies
     * are harmless, for example it will reports "lodash.js/0.10.0/lodash.underscore.min.js"
     * and that's OK - underscore library is dependency of lodash library which is provided
     * both in release and debug versions but undescore dependency come only in minimized
     * version. The only two real problems I discovered so far are:
     *  - jquery-ui-map/3.0-rc1
     *  - jqueryui/1.10.3
     * These two libraries bundle minified files in a different folder. Something we could handle
     * on case by case basis. Because these are two libraries out of few hundreds I'm ignoring
     * it for now.
