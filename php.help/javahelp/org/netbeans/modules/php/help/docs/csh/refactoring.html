        <h2>
            Rename Refactoring
        </h2>
        <p>Rename Refactoring allows you to safely rename a PHP element across all files in an application.
            For safety, rename refactoring requires you to preview and approve your changes.</p>
        <p>Rename Refactoring involves two user interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rename dialog</b>. You opened this Help topic from the Help button in this dialog.</li>
            <li><b>Refactoring window.</b> After you complete the Rename dialog, you preview your changes
            in the Refactoring window.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rename dialog</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>New name:</b> Type the new name in this field.</li>
            <li><b>Preview.</b> You must click Preview to rename the element. Clicking Preview opens
                the Refactoring window.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Refactoring Window</h3>
        <p>The Refactoring window opens below the Editor window. The Refactoring window shows every place in your
            application that could be affected by refactoring, and lets you exclude files or individual instances
            from refactoring. The Refactoring window contains the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a name="buttons"></a><b>Navigation buttons.</b> On the left side of the Refactoring window are a series of buttons for navigating through the 
                <a href="#tree">tree of instances</a>. Hover your cursor over a button to see a tooltip describing its function.
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="../images/refactoring/nav-buttons.png" alt="Navigation buttons on left side of Refactoring window"></td>
                        <td>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Refresh</li>
                                <li>Collapse/expand all nodes in tree</li>
                                <li>Show logical view (organized by syntax)</li>
                                <li>Show physical view (organized by location)</li>
                                <li>Previous occurance</li>
                                <li>Next occurance</li>
                            </ul></td>
                    </tr>
                </table></li>
            <li><a name="tree"></a><b>Tree of instances.</b> A tree view of all instances of the element 
                that you want to rename. Using the <a href="#buttons">navigation buttons</a> you can view either a logical tree,
                organized by syntax, or a physical view, organized by location. By default, all instances are ticked.
                Untick an instance if you do not want to rename that instance. Select an instance to preview the
                current/refactored form in the preview.<br>
                <img alt="Tree of instances in Refactoring window" src="../images/refactoring/tree.png" >
            </li>
            <li><b>Preview.</b> In the preview, compare the original and refactored versions of the code line
                you selected in the tree of instances.<br>
                <img alt="Preview panel in the Refactoring window" src="../images/refactoring/preview.png">
            </li>
            <li><b>Do refactoring/Cancel.</b> After you have previewed the refactoring and excluded any
            instances that you do not want to rename, click <b>Do refactoring</b>. If you do not want to rename
            any instances, click <b>Cancel</b>.</li>
        </ul>
