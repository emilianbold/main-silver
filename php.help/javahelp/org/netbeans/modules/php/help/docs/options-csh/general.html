        <h2>General PHP Options</h2>
        <p>In this tab you set the path to the default PHP interpreter and the global Include path.</p>
        <h3>Command Line</h3>
        <p>You can set a PHP project to run as a command-line script in the project's Run 
            Configuration properties. Note that you can override 
            the default path to the PHP interpreter and set an interpreter for a project. 
            Note also that a project can have multiple run configurations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PHP 5 Interpreter:</b> the path to the default PHP interpreter. 
                The PHP interpreter is used to execute a PHP script from the command line.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Search.</b> The IDE searches for all PHP interpreters that you have installed. 
            A dialog opens in which you select which interpreter to use.</li>
                    <li><b>Browse...</b> Manually browse your file system for the interpreter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Open result in:</b> Select where to display the results of running
                a PHP application from the command-line. Tick the appropriate box to display the 
            results in the IDE's Output window, a browser, or the editor's main pane.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h3>Global Include Path</h3>
        <p>The Global Include Path are folders that are included in all PHP projects' include paths. 
            Click Add Folder to browse for a folder to add to the global include path. </p>
        <p>You can move folders up or down in the global include path. Higher folders are given priority.</p>
        <p>If you are using a PHP framework, add that framework's library folder to the global include path.</p>
