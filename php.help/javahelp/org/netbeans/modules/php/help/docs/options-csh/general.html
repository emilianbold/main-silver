        <h2>General PHP Options</h2>
        <p>In this tab you set the path to the default PHP interpreter, some debugging options, and the global Include path.</p>
        <h3>Command Line</h3>
        <p>You can set a PHP project to run as a command-line script in the project's Run 
            Configuration properties. Note that you can override 
            the default path to the PHP interpreter and set an interpreter for a project. 
            Note also that a project can have multiple run configurations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PHP 5 Interpreter:</b> the path to the default PHP interpreter. 
                The PHP interpreter is used to execute a PHP script from the command line.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Search.</b> The IDE searches for all PHP interpreters that you have installed. 
            A dialog opens in which you select which interpreter to use.</li>
                    <li><b>Browse...</b> Manually browse your file system for the interpreter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Open result in:</b> Select where to display the results of running
                a PHP application from the command-line. Tick the appropriate box to display the 
            results in the IDE's Output window, a browser, or the editor's main pane.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>In this section, set the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Debugger port </strong>This is the port that XDebug uses, 
                as set in php.ini. By default it is port 9000. <i>The port number 
                    in this dialog must be the same as the debugger port you set 
                    in php.ini. You cannot affect the port that XDebug uses in 
                    this dialog. You only inform NetBeans IDE of the port that 
                    XDebug uses.</i></li>
            <li><strong>Session ID</strong> Arbitrary name of the debugging session. 
                By default it is netbeans-xdebug. This value is important to note 
                in cases where you have to set the <tt>xdebug.idekey</tt> property 
                in php.ini, such as some remote debugging scenarios.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop at First Line</strong> Tick this option for the debugger 
                session to stop at the first line of code instead of at the first 
                breakpoint. This keeps your screen focused in the IDE instead of 
                switching to a browser window when you launch a debugging session.</li>
            <li><strong>Watches and Balloon Evaluation</strong> Due to a number 
                of bugs, watches and balloon evaluation is disabled by default. 
                See <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                    <param name="content" value="http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=181186">
                    <param name="text" value="<html><u>Issue 181186</u></html>">
                    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                    <param name="textColor" value="blue"></object>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Global Include Path</h3>
        <p>The Global Include Path are folders that are included in all PHP projects' include paths. 
            Click Add Folder to browse for a folder to add to the global include path. </p>
        <p>You can move folders up or down in the global include path. Higher folders are given priority.</p>
        <p>If you are using a PHP framework, add that framework's library folder to the global include path.</p>
