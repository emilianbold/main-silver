<h1> PhpDoc Options</h1>
<p>This page contains the path to the PhpDocumentor run script.</p>
<p>Click Search and the IDE searches for all PhpDocumentor run scripts that you have installed. A dialog opens in which you select which run script to use. Alternatively, click Browse and manually browse your file system for the run script.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PHPDocumentor is not installed with NetBeans IDE. Click the first Learn More link to open a browser window with PHPDocumentor's installation instructions.</p>
<p>You can specify configuration options in the PHPDoc script field. The contents of this field are run on the command line when you launch PhpDocumentor from the IDE. Click the second Learn More link to open a browser window with PhpDocumentor's command line configuration options.</p>
