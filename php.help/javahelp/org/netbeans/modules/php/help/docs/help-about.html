        <h2>
            About the NetBeans IDE for PHP
        </h2>
        <p>
            The NetBeans IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for PHP provides tools for 
            PHP programmers. The core of NetBeans PHP support is the PHP Editor, which
            includes code completion and other programming aids. NetBeans IDE for PHP can also be
            integrated with the Xdebug debugger, PHPUnit tester, and PHPDocumentor documentation
            generator. 
        </p>
        <p>Please note that the NetBeans IDE is designed to be as lightweight as possible. It
        does not contain visual design tools or other heavy-duty features.</p>
        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <p>The NetBeans IDE supports work with databases. Open the Services window and register
            your database by right-clicking the Databases node. You may need to add the path to your
            database driver as well. NetBeans IDE provides a tree view of database contents and an
            SQL editor. For more information, see <a href="nbdocs:/org/netbeans/modules/db/docs/connectdb.html">
                Connecting to a Database</a>.</p>
        <h3>Remote Development</h3>

        <p>The NetBeans IDE includes support for Subversion, Mercurial, and Git versioning systems. 
            You can also add CVS support as a plugin. See 
            <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/collab/collab_about.html">About
                Collaborative Development</a>.</p>
        <p>NetBeans also provides basic support for FTP/SFTP, sufficient for a lone developer to work on
            a simple project. If you are working on a complicated project or with multiple developers,
            you should use a version control system. If you must use FTP/SFTP with a complicated project, consider
            using the IDE in combination with a full-featured FTP client.</p>
        <h3>Public Releases and Development Builds</h3>
        <p>To see the latest features and try them out while they are in progress, install a daily development build
        of the IDE. For a safer alternative, use the public release. Both public release and development builds can
        be installed from http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html. Look for the Development link.</p>
