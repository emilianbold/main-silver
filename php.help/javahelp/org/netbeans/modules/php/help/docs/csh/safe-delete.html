        <h2>Delete</h2>
        <p>Before you delete a file, you have the option to search your project for all uses of the file.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Safely delete (with usage search).</b> Select this option to search your project 
                for all uses of the file before you delete it. </li>
            <li><b>OK.</b> Delete file without usage search. This button is enabled only if you do not
                select <b>Safely delete</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Preview</b> and <b>Refactor.</b> These buttons appear if you select <b>Safely delete</b>.
                Both buttons open a list of <a href="#warnings-errors">Warnings and Errors</a>. 
            <ul class="note">
                <li>This panel is inherited from Java safe delete, which behaves differently. This is why
                there are two buttons, Preview and Refactor, that do the same thing.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="warnings-errors"></a>Warnings and Errors</h3>
        <p>A list of warnings and errors appears before you can safely delete a file. If the IDE finds any
        errors, you cannot delete the file until the errors are solved. You can delete the file if there
        are only warnings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Show Usages.</b> Opens the <a href="#usages">Usages window</a>, which shows all usages
            of the file.</li>
            <li><b>Refactor.</b> Delete the file. Enabled only if no errors are found.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="usages"></a>Usages Window</h3>
        <p>If you select Show Usages in the Delete dialog, that dialog closes and the Usages window opens. 
            The Usages window shows all usages of the file you want to delete.</p>
        <ul><li><a name="buttons"></a><b>Navigation buttons.</b> On the left side of the Usages window are a series of buttons for navigating through the 
                <a href="#tree">usages</a>. Hover your cursor over a button to see a tooltip describing its function.

            <li><a name="tree"></a><b>Usages.</b> A tree view of all usages of the file 
                that you want to delete. Using the <a href="#buttons">navigation buttons</a> you can view either a logical tree,
                organized by syntax, or a physical view, organized by location. Double-click a usage in the tree, and the editor
                focuses on that line in the code. (If the file containing that usage is not open, the IDE opens it.)<br>
