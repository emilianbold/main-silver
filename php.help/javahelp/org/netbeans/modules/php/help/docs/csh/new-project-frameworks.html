          <li><b>Options.</b> Click this link to open the IDE's PHP Options dialog on the Symfony tab. 
          Click Help in that dialog for more information.</li>
          <li><b>Generate Project: Parameters</b> Symfony parameters for generating this project.
          To set the parameters for all Symfony projects, click the Options link.</li>
          <li><b>Generate following applications:</b> Select whether to create frontend, 
          backend, or other applications. Frontend is selected by default. Select an application
          and a field opens for the Symfony parameters for that application. These 
          parameters are identical in syntax to the command line parameters. Please refer to
      Symfony documentation for more information about these parameters.</li>
