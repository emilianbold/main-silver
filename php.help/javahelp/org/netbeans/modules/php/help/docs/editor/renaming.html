<h2>Rename Refactoring and Instant Rename</h2>
        <p>Rename Refactoring lets you rename an element such as a class name across all files in a project. 
            The feature forces you to preview your changes before you can make them. 
            The preview window shows you every location of the element and lets you 
            exclude individual occurrences of the element from being renamed.</p>
        <p>Instant Rename is a simpler function that only works in "non-public" contexts,
            such as renaming a variable inside a method, or renaming private variables and fields.
            Instant Rename lets you only rename an element within a file and does not provide a preview window.</p>
        <p>To use Instant Rename, place the cursor on a name you want to change and press Ctrl-R. 
            If Instant Rename applies to that variable, all instances of that variable or function 
            name are highlighted. Change one instance of the name and all other instances 
            in the file are changed simultaneously</p>
        <p>To use Rename Refactoring, select the element you want to rename and either 
            press Ctrl-R or right-click and select Refactor &gt; Rename.
            A dialog opens for you to rename the element. Rename the element and 
            press Preview. The Refactoring window opens. In this window, you can find every instance of
            the element in your project and decide whether or not to rename it.</p>
