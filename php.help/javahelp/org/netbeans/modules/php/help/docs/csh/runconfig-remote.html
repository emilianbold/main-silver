        <h2>Run Configuration: Remote Web Site</h2>
        <p>If you select Run As: Remote Web Site in the Run Configuration panel, FTP/SFTP options appear.</p>
        <p>NetBeans provides basic support for FTP/SFTP, sufficient for a lone developer to work on
            a simple project. If you are working on a complicated project or with multiple developers,
            you should use a version control system. NetBeans IDE supports a number of version control
            systems and other collaborative development tools. If you must use FTP/SFTP with a complicated project, consider
            using the IDE in combination with a full-featured FTP client, and editing the PHP project 
            in the IDE as a local web site.</p>
        <h3>Remote Web Site Options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project URL:</b> By default, this is http://localhost/ + the path to the copy of your project sources
                that is in your web server's public folder. You can change the URL if you have a different path mapped to your server.</li>
            <li><b>Index File:</b> By default, this is index.php. 
                <ul><li><b>Browse...</b> Click to browse your project files for a
                        different index file.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Arguments:</b> Arguments for running the index file. For example, <tt>debug=true</tt>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Remote Connection:</b> Select which remote connection to use. To add
                or edit a remote connection, click <b>Manage</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Upload Directory:</b> Directory to contain your project. The Upload Directory 
                is relative to the initial directory you specified when you set up the connection.
                If you do not specify an Upload Directory, your project will be uploaded to the
                initial directory. You must begin the Upload Directory with a forward slash, /.
                The full upload path appears below the Upload Directory field.</li>
            <li><b>Upload Files:</b> Select when to upload your files:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>On Run: </b>Source files are uploaded to the server when you run the project.</li>
                    <li><b>On Save:</b> Every change (create, edit, rename, delete) is 
                        immediately propagated to your remote server. If the operation 
                        takes more than 1 second, a progress bar is shown.</li>
                    <li><b>Manually: </b>Files are never uploaded automatically. You must use 
                        the IDE's manual upload function.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Preserve Remote File Permissions.</b> Select this if you only want remote file permissions 
            to be preserved. </li>
            <li><b>Upload Files Directly.</b> Select this to upload files directly instead of creating
            temporary files and uploading those. Selecting this speeds up uploading but is less safe.</li>
            <li><b>Advanced.</b> (Only in Project Properties, not in New PHP Project wizard.)
                Click this button if you use remote debugging or symbolic links.
            A dialog opens in which you set path mapping.</li>
        </ul>
