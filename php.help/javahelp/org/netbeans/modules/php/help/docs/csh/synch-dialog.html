        <h2>Remote Synchronization Dialog</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>Remote Synchronization is a feature of PHP projects set to run as Remote Web Site, over FTP or SFTP. Remote Synchronization allows you to compare your local version of a project with the version on a server and to diff, upload, or download files so the local and remote versions of the project match. The Remote Synchronization dialog opens from the context menu (right click) of the Source Files folder of a PHP project.</p>
        <h3>Show Planned Operations</h3>
        <p>The IDE can perform one of several operations when synchronizing a file. 
            The table of operations shows which operation the IDE plans to perform during 
            synchronization. In this section you can select which planned operations the 
        table shows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Download.</strong> Download the remote version. Overwrite the
            local version if one exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Upload.</strong> Upload the local version to the server. Overwrite the remote version if one exists.</li>
            <li><strong>No Operation.</strong> Do not synchronize the file.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete.</strong> Delete both local and remote versions of the file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click Check All to show all planned operations. Click Uncheck All to show no planned
        operations.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Show Problems</h3>
        <p>The table of operations shows warning icons for problems associated with operations.
        In this section you select which problem icons to display.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warning.</strong> Show warning icons. Warnings indicate problems that are not severe enough to prevent synchronization.</li>
            <li><strong>Error.</strong> Show error icons. Errors are problems severe enough to prevent synchronization.</li>
            <li><strong>File Conflict.</strong> File Conflict icons indicate that both the local and the remote version of the file changed since the last synchronization.</li>
            <li><strong>File vs Directory Collision.</strong> The path to the file in the local project does not match the path to the file in the project on the server.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolic link.</strong> File is only a symbolic link pointing to another file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click Check All to show all warnings. Click Uncheck All to show no warnings.</p>
