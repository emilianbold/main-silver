            New PHP Project from Remote Server: Remote Configuration
        </h2>
        
        <p>NetBeans provides basic support for FTP/SFTP, sufficient for a lone developer to work on
            a simple project. If you are working on a complicated project or with multiple developers,
            you should use a version control system. NetBeans IDE supports a number of version control
            systems and other collaborative development tools. If you must use FTP/SFTP with a complicated project, consider
            using the IDE in combination with a full-featured FTP client, and editing the PHP project 
            in the IDE as a local web site.</p>
        <h3>Remote Configuration Options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project URL:</b> By default, this is http://localhost/ + the path to the copy of your project sources
                that is in your web server's public folder. You can change the URL if you have a different path mapped to your server.</li>
            
            <li><b>Remote Connection:</b> Select which remote connection to use. To add
                or edit a remote connection, click <b>Manage</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Upload Directory:</b> Directory to contain your project. The Upload Directory 
                is relative to the initial directory you specified when you set up the connection.
                If you do not specify an Upload Directory, your project will be uploaded to the
                initial directory. You must begin the Upload Directory with a forward slash, /.
                The full upload path appears below the Upload Directory field.</li>
