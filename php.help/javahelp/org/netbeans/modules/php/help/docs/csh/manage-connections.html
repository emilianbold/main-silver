        <p>In this panel you create a new FTP/SFTP connection or reconfigure an existing remote connection.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> The arbitrary name of the connection. Set the name in the
                <a href="#create-new-connection">Create New Connection panel</a>.</li>
            
            <li><b>Host name:</b> The root name of your FTP host, such as http://x10hosting.com.</li>
            <li><b>User name:</b> Your user name on the FTP host.</li>
            <li><b>Password:</b> Your password on the FTP host. Leave this field
            blank and the IDE will prompt you for your password.</li>
            <li><b>Initial directory:</b> The root directory on your host for all
            of your projects. By default it is only a slash, meaning that your host name +
            user name is your root directory.</li>
            <li><b>Timeout (s):</b> Time in which the client waits for a server response
            before timing out the connection. Timeout is in seconds.</li>
            <li><b>Passive mode:</b> Tick this for the IDE to communicate with the server
            in passive mode. See <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
