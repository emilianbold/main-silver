            Project Properties: Include Path and Ignored Folders
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            The Include Path property refers to project-specific files, such as libraries,
            that are not source files but that are included in the project.</p>
        <p>The Ignored Files property is the opposite of the Include Path. These are files
        inside the PHP project that you want the IDE to ignore for FTP upload, scanning, etc.</p>
        <p>Include Path and Ignored Files properties contain the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A table listing the included or ignored files</li>
            <li><b>Add Folder.</b> button. Press this button to open a dialog where you browse
            for files to add to the include path or ignore.</li>
            <li><b>Remove.</b> Select a file or folder and press this button to remove it from
            the Include or Ignore list.</li>
            <li><b>Move Up and Move Down. (Include Path only!)</b> Select a file and 
                press one of these buttons to change the file's ranking in the list.
        A higher-ranked file takes precedence over a lower-ranked file.</li>
        </ul>
