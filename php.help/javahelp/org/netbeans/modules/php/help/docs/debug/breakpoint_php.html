<h2>PHP Breakpoints in the IDE</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> A breakpoint is a flag in the source code that tells the debugger to stop
	execution of the program. When your program stops on a breakpoint, you can
	perform actions like examining the value of variables and single-stepping through your program. </p>
<h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Set a breakpoint for a line in your PHP code. To set a breakpoint, left-click the left margin or
line number of the line. To remove the breakpoint, left-click the breakpoint icon.</p>
<p>The Source Editor indicates a line breakpoint by highlighting the line at which the
	breakpoint is set in red and placing an annotation in the left margin. The
	following table describes the debugging annotations.</p>
<ul class="note">
    <li>Users of other language support in NetBeans IDE may be familiar with other types of
    breakpoints. However PHP projects only have line breakpoints at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view and organize all IDE breakpoints by choosing Windows  &gt; Debugging  &gt; Breakpoints
(Alt-Shift-5).</p>
<h3>Organizing Breakpoints Into a Group</h3>
<p>The <a href="windows/breakpoint_view.html">Breakpoints window</a> lists all of the breakpoints defined for all of your
	 IDE projects. If you have numerous breakpoints set in the IDE, it is useful
	 to organize these breakpoints into groups. Once your breakpoints are placed
	into groups, you can enable, disable, and delete them as a single
	unit. </p>


<p> <b>To add a breakpoint to a custom group:</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Windows  &gt; Debugging &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5) to open the Breakpoints window.</li>
  <li>Right-click the breakpoint and choose Move Into Group and select a custom group from the list.
      <ul class="note">
        <li>To create a custom group, right-click the breakpoint and choose Move Into Group &gt; New
        and type the name of the new group in the dialog box.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>



<p><b>To remove a breakpoint from a custom group:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Breakpoints window, right-click the breakpoint and choose Move Into Group &gt; &lt;Default&gt;.</li>
