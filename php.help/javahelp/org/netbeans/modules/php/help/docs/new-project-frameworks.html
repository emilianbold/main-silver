      <h1>PHP Frameworks</h1>
      Currently only the Symfony framework is supported. Select the Symfony PHP Framework,
      and options open for creating frontend, backend, or other applications. Only the frontend is
      selected by default. If you select to create an "other" type application, you must give the application a name.
      For each application you want the IDE to create, a line appears where you specify the parameters
      for creating the application. These are identical in syntax to the command line parameters. Please refer to
      Symfony documentation for more information about these parameters.
      The Options link on this page opens the Tools > Options > PHP Options page, on the Symfony tab.
