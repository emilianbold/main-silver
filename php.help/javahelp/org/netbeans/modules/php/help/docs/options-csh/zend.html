<h2> Zend Framework Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Zend script:</b> The path to the Zend Framework run script and default parameters.</li>
    <li><b>Search.</b> The IDE searches for all Zend Framework run scripts that you have installed. 
        A dialog opens in which you select which run script to use.</li>
    <li><b>Browse...</b> Manually browse your file system for the run script.</li>

    <li><b>Register Provider.</b> If you are using Zend Framework 1.10 or newer, register the provider. 
    <em>Look at the output window after you click Register Provider</em>. The IDE 
    displays the result of registering the provider in the Output windows. If registration failed, 
    you may have a problem in your zf.php or Zend Framework run script.</p>
