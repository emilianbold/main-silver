<h2>New C/C++ Application Wizard: Name and Location</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Application wizard enables you to create a new C or C++ 
application project. The New C/C++ Qt Application wizard is similar, and
allows you to create a new C/C++ Application that uses the Qt libraries
and tools.</p>
<p>In the Name and Location page, you must set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the display name of the project. 
This name is also used to create the project folder.
</li>
<li><b>Project Location.</b> Specifies the folder where you want to store the 
project metadata and source code. When you create an empty C, C++, or Fortran project, you 
cannot store the project folder and project source code in separate locations like 
you can with projects based on existing makefiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Makefile Name.</b> You can change the default name of the project makefile. 
If a makefile already exists in the project folder, the default name is Makefile-<i>project</i>.mk; otherwise, 
the default name is Makefile.</li>
<li><b>Create Main File. </b> You can change the default name of the main program file, and select the
C or C++ language from a list.  By default the name is <tt>main</tt> and the language is C++. For Qt projects,
the language can only be C++.</li>
<li><b>Development Host.</b> You can select the localhost or a remote development host
that you have previously set up. The project will be built and run on the selected development host.</li>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> You can select a tool collection that has been previously configured for the selected development host.
The tool collection will be used to build and run the project.</li>
<li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the 
<a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/SettingMainCorC++Project.html">main project</a>.
</li>
</ul>
