    <h2>
       Configuring Code Assistance For Projects with Existing Sources
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      For a C/C++ project with existing sources, you can specify how your code will be parsed to
      enable the code assistance features of the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
    Code assistance is a set of IDE features that help you navigate and edit source code.
    See <a href="../EditingSourceFiles/EditingSourceFiles.html">About Editing C and C++ Source Files</a>
     for more about these features.
    </p>
    <p>The IDE can use several ways to gather information from a project to enable code assistance features.
        The build analyzer generally provides the most accurate information and is used by default. 
        The IDE gathers information from the build by analyzing system library exec calls on Oracle Solaris,
      Linux, and Mac platforms.
         </p>
      <p>The build analyzer is used when you create a project with existing sources and whenever you build the project
          to automatically discover changed code assistance configuration. The build analyzer also runs
          if you manually run the Configure Code Assistance wizard.
</p>
<p>When the build analyzer is enabled, the IDE creates an exec log during the build and code assistance is configured
        using the exec log to gather information.  When build analyzer is disabled code assistance is configured using
        the build log.        
    </p>
    <p>For some projects you might not want to use the build analyzer, so you can disable it.
    </p>
    <p><b>To enable and disable the build analyzer:</b></p> 
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click your project in the Projects window and choose Properties.</li>
        <li>Click the Code Assistance category</li>
        <li>Click the Use Build Analyzer check box.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><b>To start the Configure Code Assistance wizard do one of the following:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Output window after building the project, click the Configure Code Assistance button in the left margin.</li>
        <li>Right-click your project in the Projects window and choose Code Assistance &gt; Configure Code
      Assistance.</li>
        </ul>
