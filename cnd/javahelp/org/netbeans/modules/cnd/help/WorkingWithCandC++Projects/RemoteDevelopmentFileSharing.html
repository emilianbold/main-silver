       File Sharing with Remote Development Hosts
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>When you use a remote development host, the local and remote hosts both need
    to access the project files. This can be done through file sharing or securely copying
    the files. Before the IDE can use file sharing between the
    local and remote systems, the shared filesystem or folder must already be set up and
    accessible to both systems. Typically a filesystem is shared using NFS or Samba.</p>

    <p>If file sharing is not possible, use Smart Secure Copy to copy
    the files to the server using Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The files will be copied to a
    <tt>.netbeans/remote</tt> subdirectory located in your home user directory on
	the remote host.
    </p>
     <p>
        <b>To set up the remote host to use existing network file sharing:</b>
     <ul>
         <li>In the Services window, expand C/C++ Development Hosts.
         <li>Right-click the server you want to change and select Properties to open the Host Properties dialog box.</li>
         <li>In the Synchronization list, select File System Sharing (no synchronization) and click OK. </li>
     </ul>

    <p>
      When you use the File System Sharing option for making project files available for
      local and remote development hosts, you might need to provide path mapping information to help the
      IDE use the shared file system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>To set the path mapping for a remote host that uses file sharing:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Select Tools &gt; Options, and click the C/C++ category.

        </li>
        <li>Click Build Tools.</li>
        <li>Click Edit next to the Development Host list.</li>
        <li>In the Development Hosts Manager dialog, select the remote host that you have set up to use File Sharing.</li>
        <li>Click Path Mapper...</li>
        <li>Double-click the text entry line under Local Path, and type the full path to the
        shared directory as seen from the local machine. For example, if you are storing your
        project in a <tt>/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt> directory on <tt>myserver</tt>, you might access
        that directory as <tt>/Volumes/NET/myserver/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt> on a Mac client.
        You can click the button next to the path field to use a file browser to navigate to the directory if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Double-click the text entry line under Remote Path and type the full path to the
        shared directory as seen from the remote host. If you use <tt>/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt>
        from the remote server, enter that path as the Remote Path.</li>
        <li>Click OK in the Edit Path's Map dialog, and click OK in the Development Host Manager dialog.</li>
    </ol>
