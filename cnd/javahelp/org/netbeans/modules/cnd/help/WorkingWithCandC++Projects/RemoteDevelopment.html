        <p>Remote development enables you to run the IDE locally in your familiar desktop
            environment, while using the compute power and developer tools of a remote server
            to build your applications.</p>
        <p>Once the remote host is configured and connected, you can build, run, and debug projects
            as you normally do on your local system.  The IDE runs the remote host's tools
            on your project files, enabling you to build binaries for the remote server platform
            and use advanced tools such as those used for
            <a href="../ProfilingCandC++Projects/OverviewOfCandC++Profiling.html">
                profiling C and C++ projects</a>. The remote host might also
            have more advanced hardware, such as multicore processors to enable
            fast parallel processing of your builds.</p>

        <p>When you use a remote development host, the project files
            must be accessible from both systems. You can set up the remote host
            to obtain access to project files though a shared file system, or by
            copying the project files to the remote system. When you use the secure copy
            option, the IDE manages the project files in both locations, so you do not
            need to transfer any files yourself. If a remotely
            built project generates files that are dependencies for the project, the IDE
            prompts you to download the generated files to the local system.</p>

        <p>To use remote hosts for developing C, C++, or Fortran projects, you
            should perform the following tasks.</p>
