       New Remote Development Host Wizard: Summary

    </p>
    <p>
      The New Remote Development Host summary page lets you specify some settings to be used in
      the IDE for the remote host before you click Finish to complete adding the remote development
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Display Name</b>: Type the name you want to display for this host. The display name is
      used anywhere the development host is listed in the IDE. By default, the display name is
      <i>username@hostname</i> which indicates the user name you used to log in and the remote host name.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Default Tool Collection</b>: Select the tool collection that you want the IDE to use on the remote
      development host. The options in the list indicate the tool collections that the IDE was able to locate on the
      remote server. If you know that a set of tools should be available on the host, but it is not
      listed here, you might need to tell the IDE where to find it after you finish setting up the
      host. See <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/ConfiguringBuildTools.html">Configuring
      Build Tools</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Synchronization</b>: Select the type of file synchronization you want to use to make the
      project files accessible to the remote server. The options are Smart Secure Copy and 
      File System Sharing (no synchronization). The default option is Smart Secure Copy, which
      uses SSH protocol to transfer the project files to your .netbeans directory on the remote host.
      If the local host
      and the remote host share access to the file system where the project files are located,
      you can select File System Sharing.
    </p>
    <p>Click Finish to complete the wizard.</p>
    <p>The Development Host Manager dialog is displayed, with the new remote host added to the
    list of development hosts.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If the projects you build on the remote host are graphical applications,
        select the host in the Development Host Manager dialog and click Properties. Select
        Enable X11 Forwarding and click OK. This allows you to run the application on
        the remote host, and have the windows shown on your local desktop.</p>
