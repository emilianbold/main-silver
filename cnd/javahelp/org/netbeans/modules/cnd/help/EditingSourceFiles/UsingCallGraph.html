<h2>Using the Call Graph</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Call Graph window displays two views of the calling relationships
    between the functions of your program.  One view is a hierachical tree
    with expanding and collapsing nodes. The other view is a graphical view of the
functions called from a selected function, or the functions that 
call that function. The two views are synchronized.
</p>
<p><b>To open the Call Graph:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In the Source Editor, right-click on a function and choose Show Call Graph.
</li>
<li>The Call Graph window opens and displays the tree
of functions called by the selected function.</li>
<li>The left panel shows a tree with the function that was originally selected at the top.</li>
<li>The right panel shows a graphical view of the function and its callers and callees.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To use the Call Graph:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click a function in the Call Graph graphic window and select Expand Callees
to add to the call graph all the functions that the selected function calls. </li>
<li>Right-click any function and select Expand Callers to add the functions that call
the selected function.</li>
<li>Double-click a function to jump to the source file where the function is declared. You
can also right-click the function and select Go to Declaration to jump to the source file.</li>
<li>Save a PNG image of the call graph by right-clicking anywhere in the Call Graph window
    and selecting Export.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buttons at the left side of the Call Graph window allow you to 
change the display of the call tree nodes and graph.
