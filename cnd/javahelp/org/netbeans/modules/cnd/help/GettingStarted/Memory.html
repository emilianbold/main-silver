<title>Memory Requirements for Large Projects</title>

<h2>Memory Requirements for Large Projects</h2>

<p>The 32-bit version of Java SE 6 is recommended for use on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems to avoid
large memory use by the 64-bit JVM.</p>

<p>ï»¿The IDE automatically determines the default limit for memory heap size for the JVM in
which it is running, based on the amount of memory available on the system. The default heap size
should be adequate if you are developing C/C++ applications with up to 5000 source files
on a system with 2GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. If you are developing applications
with more than 5000 source files, you need to increase the heap size or
you might get out of memory exceptions from the IDE parser.
</p>
<p>
The recommended heap sizes for working with
large C/C++ applications are as follows:</p>
<table  WIDTH=50% BORDER=0  CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=0>
    <thead>
        <tr>         
            <th align="left">Size of project</th>
            <th align="left">Heap size</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
                <tr>              
                    <td>
                       1 to 5000 files</td>
                    <td>
                       Default</td></tr>
                <tr>
                   
                    <td>
                        5000 to 10000 files
                    </td>
                    <td>1.0 GB
                    </td></tr>
                <tr>
                    
                    <td>10000 or more files
                    </td>
                    <td>1.5 GB</td>
                </tr>
               
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
You can set the heap size for the JVM on which the IDE runs in the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> 
file.
<p><b>To change the heap size:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> from the <tt>etc</tt> 
folder in the NetBeans 
installation directory
into the <tt>etc</tt> directory in your NetBeans user directory (<tt>$HOME/.netbeans/6.9/etc</tt>).
You might need to create the <tt>etc</tt> directory.
</li>
<li>In the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file in your user
directory, add the <tt>-J-Xmx</tt>
command line Java startup switch (bolded below) in the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file.
In this example, the heap is set to 2 Gb.
<pre>
# command line switches
netbeans_default_options="-J-Xms32m <b>-J-Xmx2g</b> -J-XX:PermSize=32m
-J-XX:MaxPermSize=96m -J-Xverify:none -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true"
</pre></li>
<li>Restart the IDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>To insure that you do not run out of memory while the built-in parser is
running, you can also add the garbage collector switches <tt>-J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC</tt>
(concurrent collector) and <tt>-J-XX:+UseParNewGC</tt> (parallel collector) to the 
<tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file.</p>
