       You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt; Options and clicking the C/C++ category.
    </p>
    <p>
       The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project settings, code
      assistance settings, highlighting settings, and accepted file extensions for your C and C++
      projects. These options are used as default values for new C and C++ projects. Some of these
      settings can be overridden on individual projects by <a href=
      "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/SettingCandC++ProjectProperties.html">setting project
      properties</a> .

    <p>
       <b>Development Host</b>. The list includes your local host and any remote hosts you have
      defined. You can add and remove remote development hosts, change the default host, and
      specify how to share project sources on the local host with the remote host. For information
      on using remote hosts, see <a href=
      "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, click Add.
        The New Remote Development Host wizard starts. See the help for the <a href=
        "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">New Remote
        Development Host wizard</a> for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        To set a host as the default development host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager
        dialog box, select the host, click Set as Default, then click OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, select the
        host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        To map shared project sources on the local host to a remote host, click Edit. In the
        Development Host Manager dialog box, click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog box,
        select the remote host in the Host list. For each mapping, in the Local Path field, type
        the path used to access the shared project sources from the local host. In the Remote Path
        field, type the path used to access the shared project sources from the remote host.
      </li>
      <li>
        To change IDE properties related to the remote development host, click Properties. In the
        Host Properties dialog box, you can change the name displayed in the IDE for the host by
        typing in the Name field. To change the way project files are shared with the remote host,
        select the file synchronization method in the Synchronization list. If the project files
        are in a shared folder accessible from the local host and remote host, select File System
        Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select scp to use the secure copy command to
        copy the files. The files are copied to your .netbeans directory by default. This can be
        changed with the Path Mapper.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
      currently selected development host. The default collection for that selected host is listed
      in bold type. You can modify the tool collection list by adding or removing collections. Be
      sure to select the Development Host before you modify any information about the tool
      collection.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add New
        Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically. You
        can specify a different name for the collection. If you change the family, make sure that
        the family you specify is the correct family for the collection or the compiler flags might
        not be valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
        directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers for the current development host.
      The path can be edited for the local host or remote hosts, but browsing to select a different
      path only works on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. The default compiler is the
      first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a compiler, or click
      the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. The default compiler is
      the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a compiler, or
      click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The Fortran compiler to use for building projects. The default
      compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a
      compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Assembler.</b> The assembler utility to use to translate assembly language projects into
      machine code. The default assembler, if any, is the first one found in the base directory.
      You can type a different path to a compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a
      different assembler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building projects. The default command is
      the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a make command,
      or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging projects. The default command
      is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a gdb command,
      or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <!--these might move somewhere else
      <p>
      <b>QMake Command.</b> The command to use for building Qt projects.  You can type the path to a qmake command,

      </p>
      -->
    </p>
    <p>
       The <b>Versions...</b> button displays the version numbers of each tool in the selected Tool
      Collection.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <b>Restore Defaults</b> button can be used to make the IDE search your environment for
      tool collections and update the paths to all the tools.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Make Options.</b> Global options for the <tt>make</tt> command.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. Always Relative mode
        stores paths as relative to the project root. Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute
        paths. Auto mode stores paths as relative to the project root if inside the project,
        otherwise as absolute path.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, saves all unsaved files in
        the IDE before running make. It is recommended to leave this property selected because
        modifications to files in the IDE are not recognized by make unless they are first saved to
        disk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
        single Output window tab, deleting the output from the previous process. If not selected,
        opens a new tab for each make process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add <tt>make state</tt>
        statements to the makefile.

      <li>
        <b>Show binary files in Projects view.</b> If selected, the Projects view shows all files
        in a directory tree, including binary objects. This option is most relevant to projects
        created with existing sources, which might place sources and binaries in the same location.
        Deselect this option to more easily see your C/C++ source files and header files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show profiler indicators during run (new projects only).</b> If selected, profiler tools
        such as CPU Usage and Memory Usage are set up to run by default when newly created projects
        are run. The tools that are shown are determined by the Profile Configuration selected in
        Tools &gt; Profiler Tools.
