       Managing C/C++ Profile Configurations
    </h2>

    <p>
      Profile configurations provide a way to quickly select the C/C++ profiling tools that you want to be displayed
      each time you run your C/C++ project. </p>
    <p>
      By default, each profile configuration is set up to include only those profiling tools that can run in a given development environment,
     which is indicated in the name of the configuration. The profiling tools use underlying features of the operating system
     to gather data about the running project.  Several advanced tools require the use of DTrace technology, which is available
     only in the Solaris 10 OS and the OpenSolaris OS.  Some of the advanced tools can use Sun Studio software to gather
     information, so they are supported on Solaris OSes and Linux when Sun Studio tools are present.</p>

    <p>You can modify any of the profile configurations to add or remove individual tools.  However, you can only add tools
    that will work for the environment indicated.</p>
    <p>If none of the available profile configurations suit your needs, you can also create your own profile configuration
        to specify your own set of tools that you want to use.</p>

    
    <b>To view the tools in each profile configuration:</b>
    <ol><li>Select Tools &gt; Profiler Tools to open the Profiler Tools Manager.
            <br>
        The Profiler Tools Manager can also be accessed from a project's Project Properties dialog box by
        clicking the ... button next to the Profile Configuration option in the Profile properties panel.</li>
        <li>Select a configuration from the Profiler Configuration list.<br>
        Each tool included in the configuration is shown with a check mark.  Tools that are not
        supported for the configuration are not selectable. </li></ol>

    <b>To modify an existing profile configuration:</b>
      <ol><li>Select Tools &gt; Profiler Tools to open the Profiler Tools Manager.
        </li>
        <li>Select a configuration from the Profiler Configuration list.<br>
        Each tool included in the configuration is shown with a check mark.  Tools that are not
        supported for the configuration are not selectable. </li>
        <li>Select the tools you want in the selected configuration and click OK.<br>
        When you use this profiler configuration for any project, the modified list of
        tools are run.</li>
      </ol>
    <b>To add a profile configuration:</b>
 <ol><li>Select Tools &gt; Profiler Tools to open the Profiler Tools Manager.
        </li>
        <li>Select Manage Configurations... in the Profiler Configuration list.</li>
        <li>In the Profiler Configurations Manager dialog box, select a configuration that is similar to one you want to create.</li>
        <li>Click Duplicate, then click Rename</li>
        <li>Type the name of your new profiler configuration and click OK.</li>
        <li>Click OK in the Profiler Configurations Manager dialog box.</li>
         <li>Select the new configuration in the Profiler Tools Manager, select
             the tools you want in the new configuration,  and click OK.<br>
        When you use this profiler configuration for any project, the selected list of
        tools are run.</li>
      </ol>
