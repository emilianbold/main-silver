      <p>If you are running the IDE on a Solaris 10 OS, OpenSolaris OS, or Linux OS, you have several tools available to help
      find problems in your threaded C/C++ applications.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The Thread Usage tool can be used to find places in your code where threads are waiting to obtain a mutex lock.  When you click
          the tool's Sync Problems button, you can see the functions in your application that waited to obtain a lock, and click the functions
          to go to the source file. This tool also works on Linux systems that have the Sun Studio toolchain installed.</li>
          <li>The Thread Microstates tool can be used to examine the changing states of all your application's threads. When
          you click the tool's Thread Details button, you can see the changing state of individual threads throughout the project run time.
         This tool requires the DTrace utility, which is only available on Solaris operating systems. </li>
          <li>The Data Races and Detection tool can be used to perform a deeper analysis of your application to
              detect data races and actual and potential deadlocks. This tool requires the Sun Studio tool collection, and works on
              Linux and Solaris OS.  This tool is not part of the Profile Configurations because
          the work it performs can cause potentially significant system overhead. You must explicitly run it on your project. </li></ul>
