    <h2>
       Run Monitor Window for C/C++/Fortran Projects
    </h2>
    <p>
       <a href="#seealso"><small>See Also</small></a><small>&nbsp;</small>
    </p> 
    <p>When you run a C/C++/Fortran project, the Run Monitor window opens to display indicators for tools
        that automatically profile the running program. The tools are described in
         <a href="OverviewOfCandC++Profiling.html">Overview of C and C++ Profiling</a>.
    
    The Run Monitor window has the following features:
    <ul>
  <li>The Run Monitor window can be resized and scrolled vertically and horizontally,
     so you can see all the indicators and more data.</li>
  <li>When you mouse over each tool, a popup window opens to explain what the tool does.
  </li>
  <li>Each tool includes a button that you can click to get more detailed information. The detailed
  information is displayed in a new window that by default displays as a tab below the Source Editor.</li>


  <li>Three sliders at the bottom of the Run Monitor window enable you to change the
      focus on the data in the graphs.
      <ul>
          <li><b>View slider.</b> The top slider is used to select the portion of the time line
              to view in the graph. Click and drag the beginning and end points of the slider and
              the graphic resizes accordingly, with an effect similar to zooming.
              </li>
              <li><b>Details slider.</b> The middle slider, colored orange, is used to select a portion of the runtime
                 for the Details window.  Click and drag the beginning and end
                 points, and the area that is highlighted in between the points is the time
                 segment that will be examined in the detailed information window. This area
              can also be specified by using the Time Filter controls in the Details window.</li>
              <li><b>Time slider.</b> The bottom slider can be used to slide back and forth through
                  the run time.
                 </li>
      </ul>

  </li>
  <li>If your user account does not have sufficient permissions to collect the data needed
      for the tools, the message "Indicator needs special access rights" is displayed, along
      with a Repair button. If you know the root password or the password to another account
      with administrator privileges, you can click the Repair button. The IDE prompts you
      to enter the privileged user and password and temporarily assigns the required
      permission to your account.</li>
