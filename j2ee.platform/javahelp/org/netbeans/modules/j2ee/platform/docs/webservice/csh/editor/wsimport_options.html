        <h2>Web Service Attributes Editor: Wsimport and xjc Options</h2>
        <p>For JAX-WS client Web Service References, the Web Service Attributes Editor provides a tab for viewing and modifying the options
            for the wsimport and JAXB XML binding compiler (xjc) Ant tasks.</p>
        <h3>Wsimport Options</h3>
        <p>The wsimport tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service Endpoint Interface (SEI)</li>
            <li>Service</li>
            <li>Exception class mapped from wsdl:fault (if any)</li>
            <li>Async Reponse Bean derived from response wsdl:message (if any)</li>
            <li>JAXB generated value types (mapped java classes from schema types)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>For a description of the available wsimport tool options, please see the <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
            <param name="content" value="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/wsimport.html">
            <param name="text" value="<html><u>Java wsimport documentation</u></html>">
            <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
            <param name="textColor" value="blue"></object>. </p>
    <p>Note that in addition to these options, the <tt>Xnocompile</tt> option is also available. Set it to "true" and it prevents
        the compilation of generated Java classes. The default value is "false." There were problems with this option in earlier
    versions of JDK 6.</p>
    <h3>JAXB XML Binding Compiler (xjc) Options</h3>
    <p>For information about xjc and its command line and Ant task options, please see the <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
