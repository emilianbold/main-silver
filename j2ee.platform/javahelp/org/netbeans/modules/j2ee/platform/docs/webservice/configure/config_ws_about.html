        <h2>About Configuring Web Services</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You configure your web services at several different levels.</p>
        <h3>Project Contents and Classpath</h3>
        <p>Basic project settings like the web application or EJB module's source roots and classpath are 
        set in the module's Project Properties dialog box. You open this dialog box 
        by right-clicking the project node and choosing Properties.</p>
        <p>For standard projects, you can add source roots in the Sources page of the 
        Project Properties dialog box. You can quickly add to the compilation and test 
        classpath by right-clicking the Libraries or Test Libraries node in the Projects 
        window. To further configure the classpath, or to specify which items should 
        be included in deployment, use the Libraries page of the Project Properties 
        dialog box.</p>
      
        <h3>JAX-WS Service Compilation Settings</h3>
        <p>For JAX-WS web services, you can either use the <a href="../nodes/wsitconf-EditWSAttributesCookieImpl.html">
                Web Service Attributes editor</a> or generate
                WSDL and Schema files and edit them manually. </p>
        <p>To use the Web Service Attributes editor, go to the Projects window, find the
        project's Web Services node, right-click the web service and select Edit Web Service Attributes.</p>
        <p>To generate WSDL and Schema files, go to the Projects window, find the
        project's Web Services node, right-click the web service and choose Generate and Copy WSDL. A
        wizard opens in which you select the location for the WSDL and schema files. After you generate the
        schema and WSDL, you can edit them manually. After editing these files, you need to add a wsdlLocation
        attribute to the service's @WebService annotation. The wsdlLocation attribute's value is the path to the
        generated WSDL.</p>
        
        <p class="note" >If you copy and edit the WSDL and schema files, you must add the wsdlLocation to the 
            web service. The IDE generates a WSDL file at build time, and if the wsdlLocation is not specified,
            the IDE uses the WSDL it generates itself instead of the one you generated.</p> 
        <h3>RESTful Service Compilation Settings</h3>
        <p>The main decision you make when you create a RESTful service is how to register that service. When you 
        create the service, the IDE opens a dialog where you choose whether to use the default web.xml deployment
        descriptor created by the IDE or to write the registration yourself. For EE6 services, you also have the
        choice of using an IDE-generated subclass of javax.ws.rs.core.Application. After you create the service, you can
        change how the service is registered by going to the Projects window, right-clicking the application's RESTful 
        Web Services node, and choosing REST Resources Configuration.</p>
        <p>You can also generate and edit a WADL for a web application. To generate the WADL, select New File &gt; Web Services
        &gt; WADL Document. To help you edit the WADL document, install the WADL Designer plugin.</p>
        <h3>Deployment Settings</h3>
        <p>There are several key steps to configuring deployment settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Setting the target server.</b> You can set the target server instance for a project by doing 
                any of the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying the server in the New Project wizard when creating the project.</li>
                    <li>Going to a project's Project Properties dialog box and setting the 
                    target server in the Run page.</li>
                    <li>Adding the module that contains the web service to an enterprise application. The module is then 
                    deployed to the same server instance as the enterprise application.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Adding the project module to a Java EE Enterprise Application.</b> You can add a web application or EJB module 
                to an enterprise project by doing either of the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying the enterprise application in the New Project wizard when 
                    creating the project.</li>
                    <li>Right-clicking the Java EE Modules node for any enterprise application 
                    project and choosing Add Java EE Module.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Configuring web services via annotations.</b>  
                The IDE generates annotation snippets
                in the artifacts that it creates and lets you use code completion to fill out the
                annotation snippets.
                
            </li>
            <li><p><b>Configuring web services via deployment descriptors.</b> 
                You can manually 
                configure your deployment descriptors by opening the project's web.xml deployment descriptor.
                In the case of EE6 RESTful services, which by default do not have deployment descriptors,
                you can generate a deployment descriptor by adding New &gt; Web &gt; Standard deployment 
                descriptor (web.xml). </p>
                <p>Changes made to the web.xml deployment descriptor override configuration 
                settings in annotations.</p>
                
          
                
            </li>
        </ul>
