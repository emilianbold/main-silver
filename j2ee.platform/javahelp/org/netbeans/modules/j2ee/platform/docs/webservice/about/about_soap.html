        <h1>About SOAP (JAX-WS) Web Services</h1>
        <p>JAX-WS is a technology for building web services 
            and clients that communicate using XML. JAX-WS allows developers to 
            write both message-oriented and RPC-oriented web services. JAX-WS simplifies
            web services compared to the older JAX-RPC standard by using <em>annotations</em>,
            a Java EE 5 innovation. </p>
        <p>A JAX-WS web service consists of an <em>implementation class</em>, which
            is a Java class that implements the service
            endpoint. The implementation class defines the service endpoint interface 
            implicitly, by default. </p> 
        <p>The implementation class is annotated with @WebService or @WebServiceProvider.
            The web service's operations are defined in methods in the implementation
            class. These methods are annotated with @WebMethod.</p>
        <p>In Java EE 6, the JAX-WS web service can be implemented as a stateless session bean. To
            use an EJB with a web service in EE 5, you have to create a separate EJB module
            and add that module to the web application's classpath. You can combine
            the web application and the EJB module in an 
            <a href="../../enterprise/general/about_ent_apps.html">Enterprise Application</a>.</p>   
        <p>In JAX-WS, messages to and from the web service use the XML-based protocol 
            known as "SOAP". The SOAP specification defines the envelope structure, encoding rules, 
            and conventions for representing web service invocations and responses. These calls 
            and responses are transmitted as SOAP messages (XML files) over HTTP.</p>


    </ul> 

    <p>JAX-WS depends on the following specifications:</P>
    <UL>
        <LI><P><B>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).</B> Defines the
                mechanism by which a web service is called and how data is returned.
                For detailed information, refer to the SOAP 1.2 Specification. 
            </P>
        <LI><P><B>WSDL (Web Services Description Language).</B> Describes the
                external interface of a web service. For detailed information, refer
                to the WSDL 1.1 Specification. 
            </P>
        <LI><P><B>UDDI (Universal Discovery, Description, and Integration).</B>
                Registries contain information about web services, including the
                location of WSDL files and the location of the running services. The
                IDE does not let you publish web services to or
                browse from a UDDI registry, although the WSDL files that you
                use can come from a variety of sources, including a UDDI registry.</P>
        <LI><P><B>JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding).</B>
                JAX-WS delegates data binding related tasks
                to JAXB. The JAXB 2.0/2.1 specification is developed
                in parallel with JAX-WS 2.0/2.1.</P>
