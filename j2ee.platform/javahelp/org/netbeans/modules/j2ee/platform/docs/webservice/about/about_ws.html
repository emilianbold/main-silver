        <h2>About Web Services</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>Web services are distributed application components that conform to standards 
            that make them externally available. They solve the problem of integrating diverse 
            computer applications that have been developed independently and run on a variety 
            of software and hardware platforms.</p>
        <P>The promise of web services architecture is to allow you to
            connect applications that were developed on different platforms and
            in different programming languages. This can only work if vendors can
            agree on common standards. 

        <p>The following web service programming models are supported
            by the IDE:
        <ul>

            <li><b>SOAP Web Services (JAX-WS).</b> SOAP is an XML protocol that can
                be used for messages to and from a web service. Java API 
                for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) is the specification for SOAP web
                services that is supported by NetBeans IDE. For more details, see <a href="about_soap.html">About
                    SOAP Web Services</a>.</li>
            <li><b>REpresentational State Transfer (REST).</b> 
                Central to REST is the concept of resources identified by universal 
                resource identifiers (URIs). These resources can be manipulated using
                a standard interface, such as HTTP, and information is exchanged 
                using representations of these resources. For more
                details, see <a href="about_rest.html">About RESTful Web Services</a>.</li>
        </ul>
