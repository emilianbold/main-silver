<h2>Building an Enterprise Application</h2>

<p>You can build an enterprise application project from the main menu or an individual project from its popup menu.</p>
<p><b>To build an enterprise application project and its modules:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the enterprise application project in the Projects window.</li>
    <li>Choose Run &gt; Build Project (F11) from the main menu.
        <p>Alternatively, you can right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Build.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
    <ul class="note">
    <li>If the enterprise application project is set as the main project, you can choose Run 
        &gt; Build Main Project (F11) from the main menu.
        You can set a project as the main project by right-clicking a project in the 
        Projects window and choosing Set as Main Project or by choosing Run &gt; Set Main Project 
        from the main menu and selecting the project in the sub-menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To build an individual enterprise application project and its modules:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you build an EJB module as part of an enterprise application, the IDE 
does the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiles the classes for each of the enterprise application's modules to 
    the module projects' <tt>build/ear-module</tt> folder.</li>
  <li>Places any JAR files, libraries, or directories that are on the classpath 
    of the module projects and are scheduled for inclusion in deployment in the 
    enterprise project's <tt>build</tt> folder.</li>
  <li>Builds each module's JAR file or WAR file to the module project's <tt>dist</tt> 
    folder and copies it to the enterprise application project's <tt>build</tt> 
    folder. The module JAR files and WAR files do not contain any of the module's 
    classpath elements. </li>
  <li>Puts a <tt>Class-path</tt> entry in each of the modules' manifest file for 
    all included JAR files and puts a <tt>.</tt> entry if there is at least one 
    directory on the project's classpath scheduled for inclusion in deployment. 
    This mechanism ensures that the JAR files and directories can be used from 
    the modules even if they reside in the EAR project and not in the modules 
    themselves. </li>
  <li>Builds the enterprise application EAR file to the enterprise application 
    project's <tt>dist</tt> folder.</li>
</ul>
