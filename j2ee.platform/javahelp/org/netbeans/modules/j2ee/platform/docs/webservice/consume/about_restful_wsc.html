        <h2>About RESTful Web Service Clients</h2>
        <p>NetBeans IDE helps you create two kinds of clients for RESTful web services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Java Clients.</b> The IDE generates a Java client for a RESTful service
            based on the Jersey Client API. The client code can be generated in an existing Java  class, or the IDE
            can generate a client class in a Java application, Web application, or NetBeans module. Java Client generation
            uses the <a href="wsc_rest.html">Web Services Manager</a>. </li>
            <li><b>JavaScript Client Stubs.</b> The IDE generates a set of JavaScript files and an HTML test
                page for RESTful web services in another Web application or for a WADL URL. For more information, see 
                <a href="wsc_stubs.html">Generating RESTful Web Service JavaScript Clients</a>.</li>
        </ul>
