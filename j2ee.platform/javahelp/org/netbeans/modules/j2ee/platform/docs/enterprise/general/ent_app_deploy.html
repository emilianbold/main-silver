        <h2>Deploying an Enterprise Application</h2>

        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

        <p>Unless your EJB modules and web application modules are designed to be deployed as stand-alone modules,
            you should always deploy them by deploying the enterprise application
            that contains them. If you run the Run or Deploy commands on an individual
            module that is part of an enterprise application, the IDE only deploys that
            module itself. Any changes you have made in the other modules in the project are
            not propagated to the server.</p>

        <p><b>To deploy an enterprise application:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>In the Projects window, right-click the enterprise application project and
                choose one of the following options:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Run.</b>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Sub-projects are compiled.</li>
                            <li>New and changed files are copied from a sub-project's build directory to
                                the EAR's deployment directory.</li>
                            <li>The target application server and domain start.</li>
                            <li>The EAR's deployment directory is used to redeploy the application.</li>
                            <li>The &quot;client&quot; for the EAR is triggered (i.e., a web application
                                opens in the IDE's default browser).</li>
                        </ol></li>

                    <li><b>Deploy.</b>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sub-projects are compiled.</li>
                            <li>The target application server and domain start.</li>
                            <li>If the application has already been deployed, any active sessions and
                                processes are terminated, and the application is undeployed from the server.</li>
                            <li>The EAR project's deployment directory is cleared (i.e., all content is
                                deleted).</li>
                            <li>All the files in the build directories for each of the sub-projects get
                                copied into the EAR's deployment directory.</li>
                            <li>The EAR's deployment directory is used to redeploy the application to the
                                target application server and domain.</li>
                        </ol>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>To undeploy an enterprise application (GlassFish):</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>In the Services window, expand the Servers &gt; GlassFish node.

                <ul class="note">
                    <li>The server must be running and <a href="../../server/server_register.html">registered with the IDE</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Expand the Applications node and locate the enterprise application you want to undeploy.</li>
            <li>Right-click the enterprise application node and choose Undeploy.</li>
        </ol>
