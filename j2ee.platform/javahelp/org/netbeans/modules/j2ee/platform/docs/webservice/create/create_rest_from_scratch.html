                work with RESTful web services,

        <p>You can use NetBeans IDE to create a RESTful web service in a Java Web application. You can use the IDE to create
        either an "empty" service based on a pattern (singleton or item/container) or a service configured to communicate with
        an existing database. In addition, you can expose any suitable Java class as a RESTful web service by 
        appending it appropriately.</p>
        
        <p><b>To generate a RESTful web service:</b>        
        
        <ol>
            
            <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.web.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/web/helpset/docs/web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.
            <li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the web application project node
                and choose New. Then choose one of the following:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>RESTful Web Service from Database.</b> This wizard creates entity classes
                        from a database and then creates RESTful web services from those entity classes.
                        <ul class="note"><li><b>Note:</b> If you do not have existing entity classes, it is
                            safer and more convenient to use this wizard instead of the Entity Classes From
                            Database wizard followed by the RESTful Web Services from Entity Classes wizard.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>RESTful Web Services from Entity Classes.</b> Creates RESTful web services from a set of existing entity classes.
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><b>RESTful Web Services from Patterns.</b>
                    Creates RESTful web services using one of the following patterns:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simple Root Resource.</b> Creates a RESTful root resource
                        class with GET and PUT methods. This pattern is useful for creating 
                        a simple HelloWorld service and wrapper services for invoking 
                        WSDL-based web services.
                        <li><b>Container-Item.</b> Creates a pair of RESTful resource
                        classes, consisting of an item resource class and its container
                        resource class. 
                        Item resources can be created and added to the container resource
                        using the POST method on the container resource class. Note 
                        that the URI for the newly created item resource is determined
                        by the container resource.
                        <li><b>Client-Controlled Container-Item.</b> Creates a pair of RESTful
                        resource classes, consisting of an item resource class and its container
                        resource class.
                        This pattern is a slight variation of the Container-Item pattern.
                        The difference is that there is no POST method on the container
                        resource class for creating item resources. Instead, item resources 
                        are created using the PUT method on the item resource class. 
                        The reason this is called Client-Controlled Container-Item pattern
                        is because the URI for the item resource is determined by the client
                        and not the container resource. 
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>    
                <p>Alternatively, you can choose the above templates
                by right-clicking the project node, choosing New &gt; Other
                and then selecting them from the Web Services category.
                
            </li>
            <li>Click Next and complete the wizard.
