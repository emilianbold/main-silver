<h2>New Master/Detail Form Wizard: Detail Options</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>
<p>The New Master/Detail Form wizard creates a new  master/ detail form that displays master-detail data from a database.</p>
<p>You open the New Master/Detail Form 
  wizard by opening the New File wizard and selecting the Swing GUI Forms category and the Master/Detail Sample Form file type. </p>
  <p>In the Detail Options page, you have to set the following properties:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Create Detail Area as.</b> Specifies how the detailed data is presented in the form. The top of the form displays a table. Specify how details are displayed in the form by selecting one of the following options:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Textfields. </b>When selected, the details are displayed as a label and a text field.</li>
      <li><b>Table.</b> When selected, the details are displayed as a table.</li>
    </ul>
	 <ul class="note">
    <li>A graphic to the right shows how the generated form will look.</li>
	</ul></li>
   <li><b>Available Fields/Available Columns.</b> Contains the list of database fields/columns that are not included into the form you create.</li>
   <li><b>Fields to Include/Columns to Include.</b> Contains the list of database fields/columns that are included into the form you create. By default all fields/columns are listed here. Select a field/column and click the left arrow button, to remove the field/column you select from the right pane. You can use the arrow buttons to add or remove fields/columns from the lists.
     <ul class="note">
    <li>Use the Up and Down buttons to place the elements in the required order in the list.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Click Finish to get a form with the selected master-detail data from a database generated in the IDE.</p>
