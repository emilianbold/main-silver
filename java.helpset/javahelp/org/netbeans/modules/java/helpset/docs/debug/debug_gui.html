<h2>Debugging Java GUIs</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>When debugging a Java GUI form, 
    you can use the Visual Debugger to help
    you locate the form elements in your source code.</p>
<p>To use the Visual Debugger, you run the application in the 
    debugger and take a snapshot of the UI that you want to debug.
    You can then select items in the snapshot and locate the
    corresponding line is the source code.
    After you locate the lines in the source code for the elements 
    that you want to debug, you can add breakpoints.</p>

<p><b>To use the Visual Debugger to locate GUI-related source code:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Run the application in the Debugger.</li>
    <li>Choose Debug &gt; Take GUI Snapshot in the main menu.
        <p>The GUI snapshot will open in a tab in the main window.</p></li>
    <li>Right-click an element in the GUI snapshot and choose a command from
    the popup menu.</li>
</ol>
    
    <!--
    it can sometimes be
    difficult to locate the GUI code for the layout and 
    event handling of the form.

    Users often need access to GUI-related code during debugging. 
    If a bug is easy to see in application GUI, it may be difficult 
    to locate the actual GUI code (layout, event handling) to put a breakpoint in it and trace it. 
    Understanding events is also difficult as they may be triggered in other than expected order, 
    which is complicated to observe using traditional debugger. 
    UI Debugger should help understand and resolve bugs in GUI applications written in JavaFX or Swing.</p>


<p>When you start a debugging session the Debugging window opens in the left 
pane of the IDE. Additional debugger windows also appear
automatically at the bottom of your screen.</p>

<p>You can also debug applications that are running on a remote machine 
by attaching the debugger to the application process.</p>
