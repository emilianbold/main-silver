<h2>Debugging: Events Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    <p>The Events window displays the events associated with GUI form elements according to 
    the triggering order and also displays the listeners that are associated with the event.
    The Events window enables you to view a list of logged events and add listeners 
    to help you with debugging the project.
    You open the Events window by right-clicking a component in the Visual Debugger and
    choosing Show Listeners in the popup menu.</p>

    <p>In the Events window you can expand the Custom Listeners node or the
    Internal SWT/Swing Listeners node to view a list of listeners in the project.
    You can right-click a listener and choose Go to Component Source to 
    open the source file at the line where the listener is defined. 
    </p>
    
    <p>To add a listener for logging purposes,
    double-click the Custom Listeners node or Event Log node to open the Select Listener dialog box
    and then select listeners from the list according to the type of event that you want to log.</p>
