        <h2>Deploying Java GUI Applications</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>In order for the applications that you create to work 
        outside of the IDE, you might have to include some extra JAR files 
        when you deploy the application. </p>
        <p>The <tt>swing-layout-1.0.3.jar</tt> file might be needed by your deployed applications. This library contains the various layout-related  
        extensions, such as the GroupLayout layout manager. This library is included in 
    version 6 of the Java Platform, so you do not need to package it with your application 
if you are deploying it to environments that have version 6 of the JRE.</p>
        <p>As of JDK 6, the Beans Binding library is not part of the Java Platform.</p>
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li>You can find these JAR files in the
            following folders on your system: 
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
				<li><tt><i>NetBeans_installation_folder</i>/java/modules/ext/ (for the Beans Binding library)</tt></li>
                <li><tt><i>NetBeans_installation_folder</i>/platform/modules/ext/ (for the Swing Layout Extensions library)</tt></li>
				</ul>
            </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>  
        
    <h3>Preparing a GUI Application for Distribution</h3>
    <p>To ensure that your GUI application can reference these libraries at
        runtime, the IDE automatically copies the library JAR files (and any other JAR 
        files on the project's classpath) to the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder 
        whenever you build the project. The IDE also adds each of the JAR files 
        to the Class-Path element in the application JAR's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
        file.</p>
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li>If your application does not make use of the support of one of 
            these libraries, that library is not included in the <tt>dist/lib</tt> 
        folder.</li>
        </ul>  
                    
        <p><b>To prepare your GUI application for distribution outside of the IDE:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zip the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder (including the lib folder) 
            into a ZIP archive.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Running a Standalone GUI Application</h3>
    <p>Once you have distributed an archive of your GUI application, 
    your application can be run outside of the IDE from the command line.</p>
        <p><b>To run a standalone GUI application from the command line:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder.</li>
            <li>Type the following:
                <blockquote>
                    <tt>java -jar <i>jar_name.jar</i></tt>
                </blockquote></li>
        </ol>
