        <h2>Invert Boolean Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use this dialog box to replace a  Boolean                 method or variable with an opposite one. You can use the Refactor command to introduce a new inverted method or variable.</p>
        <p>The Invert Boolean dialog box appears after you have chosen the Refactor &gt; Invert Boolean command while having a Boolean method or variable selected in the Source Editor.</p>
       
        <p>The Invert Boolean dialog box has the following field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>New Name.</b> Contains the name of the new  method or field to be applied. Specify the new name for the inverted method or variable by modifying this field.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you click Refactor, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Preview. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.</li>
            <li>Click Refactor.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
