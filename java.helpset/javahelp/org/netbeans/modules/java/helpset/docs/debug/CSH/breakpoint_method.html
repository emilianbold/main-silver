<h2>Breakpoint Properties: Method</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You use this dialog box to set the properties of a method breakpoint.
You set method breakpoint properties when setting a new method breakpoint or 
when modifying an existing method breakpoint.
You open this dialog box by right-clicking a method breakpoint in the Breakpoints 
window and choosing Properties.</p>

<ul class="note">
	<li>If the fields in the dialog box are already filled in, the information is based on the location of the insertion point in the Source Editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can set the following values in this dialog box.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Settings.</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Class Name.</b> The name of the class that contains the method. If the Apply Also to Anonymous Inner Classes checkbox is selected, the breakpoint also applies to all anonymous (unnamed) inner classes that the specified class contains. If an anonymous class contains another inner class (either anonymous or named), the breakpoint also applies to that inner class. </li>
                <li><b>All Methods for Given Class.</b> If selected, applies the breakpoint to all methods of the specified class. </li>
                <li><b>Method Name.</b> The name of the method in the class that triggers the breakpoint. 
                The All Methods for Given Class checkbox must be deselected to specify a method name.
                If you want to apply the breakpoint to all methods of the specified class, select the All Methods for Given Classes checkbox. </li>
                <li><b>Stop On.</b> Specifies when program execution is stopped. 
                Choose one of the criteria from the drop-down list.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Conditions</b>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Condition.</b> A Boolean expression that triggers the breakpoint when the expression evaluates to True. For information on the syntax rules for setting a condition, see <a href="../debug_syntaxrules_breakpointconditions.html">Syntax Rules for Setting a Condition on a Breakpoint</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Break when hit count.</b> When selected, enables you to specify how frequently the breakpoint is triggered. 
            Choose a criteria in the drop-down list and then specify a numerical value.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
	<li><b>Actions.</b> The actions to take when the breakpoint is triggered.
          <ul>
                <li><b>Suspend.</b> Specifies which threads in the program 
                being debugged are suspended when the breakpoint is reached. 
                You can specify no threads, all threads, or the breakpoint 
                thread. The breakpoint thread is the thread that is current 
                when the breakpoint is reached.</li>
                <li><b>Enable Group.</b> Select a group of breakpoints in the dropdown list to enable all the breakpoints in the group.
                The dropdown list contains all named groups and default groups of breakpoints organized by file, project and type.
                For more about named breakpoint groups, see <a href="../breakpoint_group.html">Organizing Breakpoints Into a Group</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Disable Group.</b> Select a group of breakpoints in the dropdown list to disable all the breakpoints in the group.</li>
                <li><b>Print Text.</b> The specified message is printed in the Debugger Console view of the Output window. For information on the tags you can include in the message, see 
                <a href="../debug_print_breakpoint_message.html">Printing a Breakpoint Message</a>.</li>
