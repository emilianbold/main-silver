        <h2>
            Java Formatting
        </h2>
        <p>This page describes the options in both Options: Editor: Formatting and Project Properties: Formatting if you select the Java language. Options: Editor: Formatting sets global options 
        whereas Project Properties: Formatting sets project-specific options. </p>
        
        <h3>The Preview Window</h3>
        <p>The Preview window contains sample code that reflects changes you make in Formatting.</p>
        <h3>Categories</h3>
        
        
        <h3>Tabs and Indents</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Expand Tabs to Spaces.</b> When selected, inserts spaces when the Tab key is typed.
            <!--The number of spaces inserted is set in the Number of Spaces per Indent property.-->
           When unselected, typing the Tab key inserts the tab character (<tt>\t</tt>) into the file if 
            possible. It also replaces preceding spaces with the tab character if possible.  
            The Source Editor calculates where to place tab characters based on the value 
            of the Tab Size property.
            <p>If Expand Tabs to Spaces is unselected and the Number of Spaces per Indent is different
            than the Tab Size property, the indentation created by typing the Tab key is 
            made up of a combination of spaces and tab characters.  It is easiest to predict 
            the location of tab characters if you set Number of Spaces per Indent to an even
            multiple or divisor of Tab Size.
                <ul class="note"><li><b>Important:</b> This feature does not convert
                        existing tabs to spaces. Only tabs that you add <i>after</i> you
                        enable this option are converted.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Indent:</b> Number of spaces per indentation level for subelements, new lines inside
                brackets, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Tab size:</b>See the description of Expand Tabs to Spaces, above.
            </li>
            <li><b>Right margin:</b> Position of the vertical red line that indicates the right margin.
                </li>     
            <li><b>Line wrap:</b> Whether lines are wrapped when they are longer than the width of the Editor window (no relationship to right margin). Options are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Off.</b> No line wrapping (default).</li>
                    <li><b>After words.</b> Words are not broken by line wrapping.</li>
                    <li><b>Anywhere.</b> Lines are broken in the middle of words by line wrapping.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
