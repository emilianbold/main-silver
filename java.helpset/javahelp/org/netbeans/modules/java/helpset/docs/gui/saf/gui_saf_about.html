    <ul class="note"><li>The Swing Application Framework (JSR 296) is no longer developed and will not become part of the official Java Development Kit as was originally planned. It is still included in the IDE and you can use this library as it is, but no further development is expected. If you are looking for a Swing-based application framework, consider using the <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.apisupport.kit/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/docs/about/about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a>.  
            The main difference between the Swing Application Framework and the NetBeans Platform 
            in this regard is scope. The Swing Application Framework is more lightweight and 
            easier to get started with. The NetBeans Platform is more full-featured and 
    better suited for large and extensible applications.</li></ul>
    <p>The Swing Application Framework is a light framework that simplifies the 
        creation and maintaining of small- to medium-sized Java desktop 
        applications. The framework consists of a Java class library that 
    supports constructs for things such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remembering state between sessions.</li>
        <li>Easier managing of actions, including running as background tasks and specifying 
        blocking behavior.</li>
        <li>Enhanced resource management, including resource injection for 
        bean properties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The IDE supports the development of applications based on the 
    Swing Application Framework in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing the Java Desktop Application project template, which 
            contains skeleton implementations of the 
            main framework features. This template enables you to choose from 
            the follow two shells:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Basic Application</b>. Provides a basic frame, some sample menu items, status bar, 
                and mechanisms for managing actions and resources.</li>
                <li><b>Database Application</b>. Provides all of the features in the Basic Application shell 
                    plus all of the features necessary for a simple database application with create, read, 
        update, and delete features.</li></ul></li>    
        <li>Integration of framework features in the IDE's GUI Builder. Swing 
            Application Framework applications can be designed in the IDE like any 
        other Swing application.</li>
        <li>Generating your application's UI text and other resources in <tt>.properties</tt> 
        files.</li>
        <li>Providing a special property editor for actions in which you can associate 
            an action with keyboard accelerators, text, and a tooltip. In addition, you 
            can configure properties for when it is selected or enabled and you can set 
        the action to run asynchronously.</li> 
    </ul>
