    <h2>Importing OSGi Bundles into a NetBeans Platform Application</h2>
    
    An OSGi bundle can be imported into a NetBeans Platform
     application to provide new features, such as those
     provided by Mylyn or the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
    <p>Take the following steps:
    <ol>
        <li>In the Projects window, right-click the application node
            and select Properties.</li>
        <li>In the Properties window, go to the Libraries tab
            and do one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Add Project.</b> Lets you add a single OSGi bundle
                 to your application.</li>
                <li><b>Add Cluster.</b> Lets you add a folder containing
                 one or more OSGi bundles to the application.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>New folders and files have now been added, enabling
         the NetBeans Platform to load your OSGi bundles
         into the application.
