<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>
<p>The New Master/Detail Form wizard creates a new  master/detail form that displays master-detail data from a database.</p>
<p>You open the New Master/Detail Form 
  wizard by opening the New File wizard and selecting the Swing GUI Forms category and the Master/Detail Sample Form file type. </p>
  <p>In the Master Table page, you have to set the following properties:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Database Connection.</b> Specifies connection information for the database from which you want to capture the table (i.e., the location of the database, which driver to use,  the username and password information). Either choose an existing database connection, or provide  details for creating a new connection to a specific database.
   <ul class="note">
    <li>By default, an APP database sample is configured when you open the IDE.</li></ul></li>
    <li><b>Database Table.</b> Specifies the table of the database that you want to
    display master-detail data from.</li>
    <li><b>Available Columns.</b> Contains the list of database columns that are not included into the table you create. </li>
    <li><b>Columns To Include.</b> Contains the list of database columns that are  included into the table you create. By default all columns are listed here. Select a column and click the left arrow button, to remove the column you select from the right pane. You can use the arrow buttons to add or remove columns from the lists.
      <ul class="note">
    <li>Use the Up and Down buttons to place the  elements in the required order in the list.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Click Next to confirm the columns selection and specify the detail options for the form you want to create.</p>
<p>In the Detail Options page, you have to set the following properties:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Create Detail Area as.</b> Specifies how the detailed data is presented in the form. The top of the form displays a table. Specify how details are displayed in the form by selecting one of the following options:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Textfields. </b>When selected, the details are displayed as a label and a text field.</li>
      <li><b>Table.</b> When selected, the details are displayed as a table.</li>
    </ul>
	 <ul class="note">
    <li>A graphic to the right shows how the generated form will look.</li>
	</ul></li>
   <li><b>Available Fields/Available Columns.</b> Contains the list of database fields/columns that are not included into the form you create.</li>
   <li><b>Fields to Include/Columns to Include.</b> Contains the list of database fields/columns that are included into the form you create. By default all fields/columns are listed here. Select a field/column and click the left arrow button, to remove the field/column you select from the right pane. You can use the arrow buttons to add or remove fields/columns from the lists.
     <ul class="note">
