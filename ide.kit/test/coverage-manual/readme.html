        <h2>How to instrument IDE for manual testing</h2>
        Ant and JDK must be installed on your system before you can run coverage tests.
        <p>
        Before starting be sure you have xtest module checked out and folder
        xtest/external contains emma.jar and emma_ant.jar, those files can be downloaded
        from <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/downloads.html">EMMA download site</a>
        (last 2.0.x version of EMMA).
        Or you can use script that downloads emma libraries for you, in that case you
        need to provide proxy settings on command line when executing Ant script:<br/>
        <code>-Dproxy.host=[proxy_host] -Dproxy.port=[proxy_port]</code>
        </p>
        
        <h4>User defined properties</h4>
        There are couple of properties that are needed to be correctly set in 
        build.xml file before you can instrument IDE. Those properties are:
        <dl>
            <dt><code><b>jdkhome</b></code> 
                <dd>Location of JDK that will be used to run instrumented IDE
            <dt><code><b>netbeans.dir</b></code>
                <dd>NetBeans installation dir, IDE on this location will be copied 
                over and instrumented (default value: nbbuild/netbeans)
            <dt><code><b>included.packages</b></code>
                <dd>List of packages that will be instrumented
                (default value: org.netbeans.*, org.openide.*, org.openidex.*, 
                javax.jmi.*, org.apache.tools.ant.module.*)
            <dt><code><b>coverage.runtime.file</b></code>
                <dd>Name of the file for writing EMMA runtime coverage data for given session 
                (default value: coverage.ec)
        </dl>
        
        <h3>Important notes</h3>
        When performing tests on instrumented IDE:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Do not run more instances</b> of NetBeans with the same .ec file (file will be corrupted)
            <li>When doing extensive long tests make sure you log <b>each session into separate .ec file</b>
        </ul>
        Use following system property to extend available memory for Ant process 
        <code><b>ANT_OPTS=Xmx512m</b></code> when generating report, 
        otherwise OutOfMemoryError will be thrown.
        
        <h3>Targets</h3>
        List of main Ant targets:
        <dl>
            <dt><code><b>instrument-ide</b></code>
                <dd>Executes all necessary subtargets and creates instrumented IDE
            <dt><code><b>run-ide</b></code>
                <dd>Runs instrumented IDE
            <dt><code><b>clean-ide</b></code>
                <dd>Deletes instrumented IDE, with userdir
            <dt><code><b>clean-emma</b></code>
                <dd>Deletes EMMA data files
            <dt><code><b>clean-report</b></code>
                <dd>Deletes EMMA report
            <dt><code><b>clean-userdir</b></code>
                <dd>Deletes IDE uderdir
            <dt><code><b>real-clean</b></code>
                <dd>Runs all clean targets above
            <dt><code><b>emma-report</b></code>
                <dd>Creates report from all available EMMA data files
        </ul>
