<h2>JavaScript Breakpoint Properties: Event</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>You use this dialog box to set the properties of a JavaScript event breakpoint.
You set event breakpoint properties when you set a new event breakpoint or 
when you modify an existing event breakpoint.
You can open this dialog box by right-clicking an event breakpoint in the Breakpoints 
window and choosing Properties.</p>

<p>In this dialog box you select the action or actions that will trigger the breakpoint and pause
    execution of the script. 
    When you set or modify an event breakpoint you can select multiple actions in multiple categories.
    You set only one event breakpoint in your application and 
    all actions that trigger the breakpoint are grouped into the single event breakpoint.
    In the Breakpoints window you will see a single event breakpoint entry 
    and a list of all the actions that trigger the breakpoint.</p>

<p>You can select the actions in the following panels.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Category.</strong> Specifies the category of the actions that trigger the breakpoint.
    When you select a category, all actions in that category are selected by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Action.</strong> Specifies the actions that trigger a breakpoint.
    You can select multiple actions.</li>
</ul>
