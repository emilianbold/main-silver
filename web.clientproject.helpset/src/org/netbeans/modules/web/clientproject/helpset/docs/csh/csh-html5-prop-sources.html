        <h2>HTML5 Project Properties Dialog Box: Sources</h2>

        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

        <p>You open the HTML5 Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking
            any HTML5 project node in the Projects window and choosing Properties.</p>

        <p>The Sources page lets you set the locations for commonly-used directories within
            the project folder of a Java web project, such as the <code>WEB-INF</code> and Web Pages
            folders. It also allows you to specify the project's source package and test package
            folders, set the JDK version that corresponds to the project's source/binary
            format, include or exclude classes to be compiled with the project, and set the
            default project character encoding.</p>


        <p>You can modify the following properties in the Sources page of the 
            dialog box.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Folder.</strong> (<em>read-only</em>) Lists the directory on your
                computer where the project sources are located.</li>

            <li><strong>Site Root Folder.</strong> Lists the top level folder of the application. 
                This folder typically contains the <tt>index.html</tt> file.</li>

            <li><strong>Unit Tests Folder.</strong> </li>


<!--
        <p>A pane is provided for both source and test package folders, listing the location of
            package folders, and the label used for them in the Project Properties window. You
            can use the Test Package Folders pane to specify the folder that the IDE uses when
            creating JUnit tests. By default, when you create a project the IDE creates a test
            packages folder called <code>test</code> with the label Test Packages. Use the buttons
            to the right of the panes to add, remove, and change the order of the package folders.</p>

        <p>To create JUnit tests with the IDE, a project must include a test package folder. If
            the test packages folder for your project is missing or unavailable, you can create
            a new folder in your project and then use this pane to designate the new folder as
            the Test Package folder.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Add Folder:</strong> Click to add a new package folder to the adjacent pane.
                In the Add Source/Test Folder dialog that displays, navigate to and select the folder
                containing the resources you want to add, then click Open. The resources are then
                added to the corresponding Package Folders pane.

                <ul class="note">
                    <li>To edit the name of a package folder listed in either of the Package Folder
                        panes, double-click the listed entry and type directly into the field.</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Remove:</strong> Select an entry in a Package Folders pane, then click the
                Remove button to delete it.</li>

            <li><strong>Move Up:</strong> Select an entry in a Package Folders pane, then click
                Move Up to have it listed higher in the pane. The order in which packages are listed
                corresponds to the order in which they display in the Projects window.</li>

            <li><strong>Move Down:</strong>  Select an entry in a Package Folders pane, then click
                Move Down to have it listed lower in the pane. The order in which packages are listed
                corresponds to the order in which they display in the Projects window.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can have multiple source roots in a standard project, with the following exceptions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project.</li>

            <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the
                same project. For example, a source root that is registered under Test Packages
                cannot be added to the list of Source Packages.</li>

            <li>All of the source roots are packaged into the same WAR file and share the
                same classpath.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you have a source root that needs to be used by several projects, you
                should create a separate project for the source root and <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.java.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/java/helpset/docs/compile/comp_dependencies.html">set
                up compilation dependencies</a> between the projects.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Source/Binary Format</h4>

        <p>You can use the Source/Binary Format combo box to set the lowest Java platform
            version with which the generated Java code should be compatible. This setting
            corresponds to the javac <code>-source</code> option. Setting the source/binary
            format helps prevent you from using Java language constructs that are not available
            in the platform version to which you want to deploy. However, setting the source/binary
            format does not ensure that the platform APIs are used compatibly with that platform
            version. To make sure that your application is fully compatible with an earlier Java
            platform version, you need to switch to the <a href="WebCustomizerLibraries.html">Libraries
            tab</a> and set the Java Platform setting to the minimum version on which you plan
            to deploy.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source/Binary Format:</strong> Choose the JDK version that applies
                to the lowest Java platform version with which the Java code in your project
                is compatible. Default options range from JDK 1.2 to 6.</li>

            <li><strong>Includes/Excludes:</strong> Click the Includes/Excludes button if you
                want to include or exclude specific classes in or from compilation. In the
                Configure Includes and Excludes dialog, use regex patterns in the Includes
                and Excludes fields to specify which classes on the project classpath you
                want to have compiled. The Included Files and Excluded Files panes list the
                resources that will be compiled based on the supplied patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Specifying the source/binary format does not change the Java platform whose libraries
                and executables are used to compile and run your project. To set the Java platform
                that is used for compiling and running your project, click Libraries and set the
                Java Platform setting accordingly. You cannot set the source/binary format of a
                project to a higher release than the project's Java platform.</li>
        </ul>-->



            <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Choose the character encoding that you want the IDE
                to apply when it saves and displays project source files.
            <p>The project character encoding determines how the IDE interprets characters in your
                source files. The IDE displays and saves any new files you create using the encoding
                set by the project in which they reside. The default character encoding used with
                projects is UTF-8. Use the Encoding drop-down to change the character encoding used
                with the project.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/project/proj_encoding.html">About
