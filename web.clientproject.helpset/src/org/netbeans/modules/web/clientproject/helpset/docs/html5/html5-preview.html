<h2>Previewing an HTML5 Application</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 

<p>A single HTML5 application might be viewed on various devices with different screen sizes.
    The IDE can help you develop projects that can respond and adapt to different
    display devices by enabling you to preview pages at different screen sizes.
    When you run the HTML5 application from the IDE you can choose to view the pages 
    in one of the default screen sizes or create a custom screen size.</p>

<p>You can view your application in any browser, but if you want to 
   be able to quickly switch between screen sizes to preview the application 
   you need to specify one of the following integrated browsers as the target browser.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Chrome with NetBeans Integration</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Embedded WebKit Browser</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When you preview the application in one of the integrated browsers you can choose 
    the display size in a menu in the browser.</p>

<ul class="note">
    <li>You can specify the target browser for the application in the Project Properties window
    or in the Set Project Configuration dropdown list in the toolbar of the IDE.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Switching Between Screen Sizes</h3>
<p>The integrated browsers provide menus that enable you to switch between
    common screen sizes that are pre-configured in the menu.
    When you select a new screen size the display area of the browser resizes to 
    the selected size. 
    By changing the screen size you can preview how the layout of the application
    responds to different sizes, for example, as a result of media queries that
    are specified in the style sheet.</p>

<p>After you launch the application you can select a screen size from the menu in the browser.
    The location of the menu for selecting the screen size options depends upon the target browser.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the target browser is Chrome with NetBeans Integration,
            click the NetBeans icon in the URL location bar to open the menu and select a screen size.</li>
            <li>If the target browser is Embedded WebKit Browser,
            click the Other Options menu icon in the Web Browser window toolbar and select a screen size from the dropdown list.
            <p>Alternatively, you can click a screen size icon in the toolbar in the Web Browser window.</p></li>
        </ul>

<h3>Creating a Custom Screen Size</h3>
<p>You can create custom sizes for windows by selecting Customize in the screen size menu.
    When you select Customize the browser displays a window that enables you to
    create a new size and to modify the default screen size options.
    You can also edit the contents of the menu.</p>
