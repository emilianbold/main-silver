        <h2>Chatting with Project Members</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>A Team project can have multiple members collaborating on a project.
        If the chat room for a Team project is enabled, you can exchange messages in the project's chat room
        from within the IDE.
        You can also engage in private chats with members of projects.</p>

        <p>To chat with project members you must be logged in to the Team Server and logged in to the chat server.
        You can log in to Chat when you log in to the Team Server.
        If you do not log in to Chat when you log in, you can enable Chat
        after you login by clicking the Offline icon in the status bar.
        For more about enabling and disabling Chat, see <a href="kenai_chat-login.html">Logging in to Chat</a>.</p>


        <h3>Project Chat Rooms and Private Chats</h3>
        <p>You can use the Chat window for a project to exchange messages with other project members.
        Each Team project can have an associated chat room open to members of the project.
        You can also have private chats with individual project members from within the IDE.</p>

        <p>To enter a chat room or initiate a private chat, perform the following steps.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Chat from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Click the New Chat button (&nbsp;<img src="images/chatwindows.png" alt="New Chat icon">&nbsp;).
                <p>The window displays a list of project chat rooms and project members that are online and available for chat.</p></li>
            <li>Double-click the name of the project to enter the project chat room, or
                the name of the member to start a private chat.
                <p>You can use the drop-down list to filter the list of online members according to project.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Notes.</strong></p>
        <ul class="note">

        in the Chat window to quickly send a link to a file or issue as a message.
        You can open the drop-down list for the button to choose from a list of open files or issues.
