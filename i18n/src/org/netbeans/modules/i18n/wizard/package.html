<h2>I18N Wizards</h2>

This package contains two wizards: Internationalization
wizard ("IW") and Test Internationalization wizard ("TIW").
Implementation is based on regular expressions ("RE") matching.

<p>
IW gathers from a user a set of files to internationalize
and then identifies using RE hardcoded strings and prepares
in-memory map of <code>HardCodedString</code>s to <code>I18nString</code>s.
User can customize it (remove a mapping or customize default
<code>I18nString</code>).

<p>
TIW gathers from a user a set of files that are RE scanned for
internationalized strings. It extracts internationalizizes string keys
and their bundles (actually user must identify bundles, i.e. one
file cannot use more bundles) and then it scans bundles for the
keys. Any missing keys are reported.

<h3>Code Paths</h3>
IW <code>I18nWizardAction</code> creates <code>I18nWizardDesctiptor</code>
populated by <code>SourceWizardPanel</code>, <code>ResourceWizardPanel</code>,
<code>AdditionalWizardPanel</code> and <code>HardStringWizardPanel</code> then
shows it.
<p>
TIW <code>I18nTestWizardAction</code> creates <code>I18nWizardDesctiptor</code>
populated by <code>SourceWizardPanel.Panel(true)</code>, 
<code>ResourceWizardPanel.Panel(true)</code>
and <code>TestStringWizardPanel</code> then shows it.
<p>
Some panels are self swapping to <code>ProgressWizardPanel</code> see 
<code>doLongTimeChanges()</code> methods.

<h3>Data Flow</h3>
All wizard gathered data are passed using a map class created by
<code>Util</code>. Map content is transferred using wizard settings.
