<h2>About the Java ME SDK</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See also</a></small></p>
<p>The Java Micro Edition SDK is a collection of tools and device emulators that support the development of Java applications that run on devices compliant
  with the Mobile Device Information Profile (MIDP), Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and Connected Device Configuration (CDC). These include a wide range of mobile phones, embedded systems, Blu-ray consoles and other devices. The Java ME SDK uses the Java SDK, Standard Edition (J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> SDK) compiler to compile your source files and provides device emulators to simulate the performance of a CLDC, MIDP or CDC application, as well as tools that help you monitor and improve the performance of your application.</p>

<p>The  NetBeans IDE comes bundled with different versions of the SDK depending on which OS you are using:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Windows</b>: Java ME SDK with CLDC/MIDP and CDC support.</li>
 <li><b>Linux</b>: Sun Java Wireless Toolkit with CLDC/MIDP support.</li>
 <li><b>Mac OS</b>: Java ME SDK with CLDC/MIDP support.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Java ME SDK supports testing with the following key features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Java ME SDK can simulate several devices including various standard mobile phone designs
  and touch screen devices. This helps you learn what type of experience users can expect and verify 
  the portability of your application across different devices.</li>
  <li> The Java ME SDK supports tracing and debugging with run-time logging 
    of various events, such as garbage collection, class loading, method calls, 
    and exceptions. You can also perform source-level debugging with an IDE while 
    an application runs in the Java ME SDK. </li>
  <li> The Java ME SDK enables you to collect information that you can examine 
    to optimize the performance of your mobile applications. Performance tuning 
    utilities include profiling methods and monitoring memory usage and network 
    traffic. Also included is the ability to adjust the speed settings for graphic 
  rendering and refreshing as well as VM speed emulation and network throughput. </li>
  <li>The new Java ME SDK includes support for the Mobile Service Architecture (MSA)
  platform as well as Nokia's Scalable Network Application Package (SNAP) Mobile API. </li>
</ul>
<p> You can access the preferences and utilities of the Java ME SDK in the Tools &amp; Extensions tab of the Java Platform Manager. </p>
