        <h2>CDC Project Properties Dialog Box: Sources </h2>
        
<p>The Sources panel enables you to view the location of the project folder, manage 
  source and test package folders, as well as set the source level of the packages 
  which the IDE will use. You open the CDC Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking 
  any CDC project node and choosing Properties. 
<p>Use the buttons on the right side of the panel to add, remove, and change
        the order of classpath elements. 
        <p>You can have multiple source roots in a CDC project, with the following exceptions:
        <ul class="tip">
            <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project.
            <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the same project. 
            For example, a source root that is registered under Test Packages cannot be added to the 
            list of Source Packages.
            <li>All of the source roots are packaged into the same JAR file and share the same classpath.
            <li>If you have a source root that needs to be used by several projects, you should create a 
            separate project for the source root and set up compilation dependencies between the projects.
        </ul>
<p>You can use the Source/Binary Format combo box  
to set the lowest Java platform version with which the generated Java code should be 
compatible. This setting corresponds to the javac <tt>-source</tt> option. 
Setting the source/binary format helps prevent you from using Java language constructs 
that are not available in the platform version to which you want to deploy. 
However, setting the source/binary format does not ensure that the platform APIs 
are used compatibly with that platform version. To make sure that your application 
is fully compatible with an earlier Java platform version, you need to 
switch to the <a href="proj_cdcstand_props_libraries.html">Libraries tab</a> 
and set the Java Platform setting to the minimum version on which you plan
to deploy.</p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Specifying the source/binary format does not change the Java platform whose libraries and executables
            are used to compile and run your project. To set the Java platform that is used for compiling and
            running your project, click Libraries and set the Java Platform setting accordingly. You cannot set
            the source/binary format of a project to a higher release than the project's Java platform.
        </ul>
