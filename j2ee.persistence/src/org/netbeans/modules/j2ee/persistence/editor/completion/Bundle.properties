ALLOW_NATIVE_SQL_QUERIES_DESC=The <code>"eclipselink.jdbc.allow-native-sql-queries"</code> property \
specifies whether any user defined SQL is allowed within a persistence \
unit. This is of particular importance within a multitenant to minimize \
the potential impact of revealing multi tenant information. By default\
any persistence unit containing at least one multitenant entity will\
cause this flag to be set to 'false'. \
<p>\
Allowed Values (String):\
<ul>\
<li>"true" - (DEFAULT) allow native SQL\
<li>"false" - do not allow native SQL.\
</ul>
JDBC_DRIVER_DESC=The <code>javax.persistence.jdbc.driver"</code> property specifies the JDBC\
DriverManager class name used for internal connection pooling when a data\
source is not being used. The value must be a string which is the\
qualified class name for a valid class that implements\
<code>java.sql.Driver</code>.\
<p>\
<b>Persistence XML example:</b> <code>\
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" />\
</code>\
<p>\
The previous value for this property <code>"eclipselink.jdbc.driver</code> is now deprecated and should\
be replaced with this new name.
