ACSD_Secondary_Table=Secondary tables enable you to map columns that are not \
part of your primary table to your bean fields. For example, you might add a \
DEPARTMENT table as a secondary table in order to include a department name in \
your Employee bean.

main properties sheet for this bean.
# {0}=related bean name (not fully qualified)
MSG_SchemaMismatch=The {0} bean is mapped to a different schema than this \

the \nmapped schema property of one of the beans.

    This wizard allows you to set up or edit the database mapping for a bean. \
    When you are finished, you will have a bean that is mapped \
    to one or more database tables.\n\n

# The value from ACSD_page1 from above will be the prefix of this in 
# the text area in the first page of the mapping wizard.
MSG_page1=\
    Before you begin, make sure that:\n\n\
    - The database schema to which you want to map this bean is captured \
    into a filesystem in the Explorer window. To capture a schema, choose New... \
    from the File menu and then select Database Schema from the Databases folder.\n\n \
    - Any beans that have relationships to the bean you are mapping are \
    configured as CMRs. Otherwise you will not be able to set up the mapping \
	for those relationship fields\n\n\
    If your bean is ready for mapping, click the Next button.

MSG_page2=\
Use the Browse... button to select the primary table (from a currently mounted database \
schema) to which you want to map your bean. Then, if you want to map additional \
tables to this bean, click the Add... button to add a secondary table.


# Related Class Panel
RMW_Initial_Step_Text=The relationship defined in the deployment descriptor \
between this bean and the related bean is shown below.\n\
If the related bean is not mapped yet, select the primary table to which it \
should be mapped. 
RMW_This_Class=This Bean:
HINT_relatedPrimaryTable=Table to which the related bean is mapped

# Map to Key Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Bottom_Text=Review the default key or \
define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs \
of columns from the tables mapped to this bean and \
the related bean.  The columns in each pair are \
expected to have the same value.  To create a compound \
key, use the Add Pair button.

# Map to Key: Local to Join Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Local_To_Join_Bottom_Text=Review the default \
key or define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs of \
columns from the tables mapped to this bean. \
The columns in each pair are expected to have the same value. \
To create a compound key, use the Add Pair button.

# Map to Key: Join to Foreign Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Join_To_Foreign_Bottom_Text=Review the default \
key or define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs \
of columns from the join table and columns from tables mapped to \
this bean.  The columns in each pair are expected to have the \
same value.  To create a compound key, use the Add Pair button.
