<h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>If you want to create a new application in the IDE, you need 
to first have a project to work in. You can 
open an existing project or create a new project.</p>
<p>When you create a project, you have your choice between the  
following groups of templates:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>BlueJ</b>. Contains the Empty BlueJ Project template, 
    which enables you to create a project that can be opened in  
    both NetBeans IDE and BlueJ. Projects created with this template 
    do not contain the full set of NetBeans IDE project features, 
    but you can later convert such a project into a NetBeans IDE project.</li>
    <li><b>General</b>. Contains several different project templates 
    for creating Java SE projects. When you select a template, 
    a description of that template appears in the bottom panel. If you are creating a new application, 
    the Java Application template is the most useful template.
    <p>When you use one of these templates, 
    your project has the full range of NetBeans IDE project features, 
    but the project can not be opened in BlueJ or in the IDE's BlueJ View 
    window.</p></li>
    <li><b>Samples</b>. This folder contains a sample application and 
    a sample project that contains examples of some Swing user interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To create a new IDE project:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li>
    <li>In the wizard, select a template and complete the wizard.</li>
</ol>
