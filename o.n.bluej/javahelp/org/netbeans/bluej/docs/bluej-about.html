<h2>About Using NetBeans IDE BlueJ plugin</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Welcome to NetBeans IDE BlueJ plugin. If you have been using BlueJ 
to learn Java technology, using NetBeans IDE BlueJ support is a logical next 
step in extending your understanding of Java program development and 
creating more complex applications. </p>
<p>You can create new projects and files 
much as you would in BlueJ and then take advantage of NetBeans IDE coding productivity 
and project management features to extend the range of your applications.</p>
<p>NetBeans IDE provides a wealth of features that make it easier to code applications 
of all sizes. These features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/codecompletion/intro.html">Code completion</a>, 
    which helps you find and quickly fill in classes, methods, and fields. 
    The code completion window is paired 
    with a Javadoc box that displays documentation for the code elements that 
    you browse in the code completion box.</li>
    <li>Marking of syntax errors in the Source Editor <i>before</i> you compile.</li>
    <li>A variety of 
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/editor_navigation.html">navigation commands</a> that enable you to easily navigate between 
    code elements and files.</li>
    <li>A <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/gui/gui_about.html">GUI builder</a>, which enables you to visually design the user interfaces for 
    Swing-based desktop applications.</li>
    <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/macros/abbreviations.html">Code templates</a> that allow you to enter long code snippets with just a few 
    key strokes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BlueJ plugin in NetBeans IDE is designed so that you can work in either 
of or a combination of the following two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep working with the BlueJ project structure but take advantage of the 
    NetBeans IDE coding productivity features.</li>
    <li>Convert to the NetBeans IDE project structure in order to create larger, 
    more scalable projects.</li>
</ul>
