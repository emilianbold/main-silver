        <h2>Source Editor Tips</h2>

        <p>The following table shows how to accomplish some common tasks 
and gives you some tips for working in the IDE's Source Editor.</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists the
            task name. The right column lists the steps to perform.">

                <td>Handle the automatic insertion of quotation marks, parentheses, and so on.</td>

                <td> 
                    <p>When you type a character that typically is used in pairs (such 
                    as a quotation mark or a parenthesis, the IDE also automatically inserts 
                    the closing character (such as another quotation mark or the 
                    closing parenthesis). If you find this distracts your typing, 
                    you can simply type the closing characters as you would normally. 
                    The IDE will use the closing character that you type and delete the 
                    character that it inserted.</p>
