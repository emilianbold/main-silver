Neither party is bound until both parties have signed the agreement and have delivered a signed copy of the agreement to the other party.

EXHIBIT A:  SUPPORT SERVICES ADDENDUM
 
Tasktop's Support Services for Products covers two areas: Error correction services and Upgrades. All Support Services will be provided in the English language only.
 
Support Services
Customer will designate support personnel who are knowledgeable about the Products to be responsible for reporting Errors and receiving and distributing Error corrections.  Tasktop's Support Team representatives will record all Error reports and coordinate responses.  Customer may submit Error reports electronically.  Customer may also request electronic status reports on reported Errors online or via e-mail.
Tasktop and Customer will cooperate in efforts to resolve reported Errors.  For all reproducible reported Errors, Tasktop will assign a tracking or ticket number, will work to determine the source of the Errors and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a fix, by-pass or work-around.  Tasktop may request that the Customer duplicate the Error, instruct Tasktop how to duplicate the Error or provide problem log dumps, diagnostic tests or other investigative support.  Customer will provide all reasonably requested information to assist in arriving at a problem solution.  In cases where Tasktop determines in its sole discretion that an Error in the standard Product has been identified by Customer, Tasktop will attempt to provide a temporary resolution, and where appropriate, provide a permanent fix to the standard Product within a commercially reasonable timeframe.
Tasktop may determine based on the information provided by Customer or through its own investigation that identified Errors were caused by non-Tasktop hardware, software, customizations, or from unauthorized modifications to Products (a Customer Error).  In the event of a Customer Error, Tasktop will either, at its sole discretion, close the ticket without fixing the Customer Error or ask the Customer if it would like Tasktop to attempt to fix the Customer Error. If Customer and Tasktop agree that Tasktop will attempt to fix a Customer Error (though Tasktop is under no obligation to do so), Tasktop will bill Customer for such efforts on a Time and Materials basis, even if Tasktop is unable to fix the Customer Error. All Error correction services will be provided from Tasktop's offices unless Tasktop and Customer mutually agree that Tasktop will travel to the Customer location. If Tasktop personnel travel to a Customer or customer location to assist in Error correction, Tasktop will charge Customer reasonable travel and living expenses, and, if the Error is a Customer Error, its normal Time and Materials charges. 
Tasktop will keep its Products compatible with the versions of third-party software listed in Tasktop's then-current product roadmap.  Tasktop will continue to maintain compatibility with such third-party software upgrades or new Releases to the extent Tasktop determines it to be financially and technically expedient to do so.
Tasktop will continue to offer Error correction services for Products following the issuance of a superseding Release for up to twelve (12) months; provided however that Tasktop may withdraw support for a Product by providing one (1) year prior written notice.
Upgrades
From time to time, Tasktop may provide Upgrades of its Products.  Upgrades may incorporate third party upgrades as well as accumulated bug fixes.  A list of supported third party software and associated upgrades are listed in the Documentation.  There will be no additional charge for Upgrades provided Customer is current, without lapse, in its Support Services fees from the date of initial licensing.  The Customer will implement provided Upgrades as soon as is reasonably practical.
Upgrades do not include new Products.  New Products provide significant new features and functions not available in the current product line, port existing Products to new hardware or software platforms, provide significant new functionality on new hardware or software platforms or are designated by Tasktop as having a new Product code.
Tasktop will provide Customer with electronic download access to or physical media containing Error corrections and Upgrades, at its sole discretion.
Support Prerequisites
Tasktop will have no obligation to provide Support Services if Customer is not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. To be eligible for Support Services, the Customer must be current, without lapse, in its Support Services fees from the date of initial licensing, and the hardware and operating system on which the Products are installed must meet Tasktop's minimum configuration requirements, which, for a given Minor Release of a Product, will be published in that Product Minor Release's Documentation.
If Support Service has lapsed and Customer wishes to reinstate Support Service on a Product, the charges for Support Services charges that would have applied during the period of Support Service suspension must be paid.
Support Service Exclusions
Unless otherwise agreed to in an applicable Order Form, no Support Services can be provided for (i) Products that are modified by Customer personnel or by third parties; (ii) problems caused by accident, neglect, misuse or improper programming by Customer personnel; (iii) failure or fluctuations in electrical power or hardware equipment; or (iv) failure of Customer to fulfill its obligations under its written agreements with Tasktop.  

Support Services do not include or cover support that becomes necessary due to:
* A malfunction of equipment or media not supplied or maintained by Tasktop;
* Extensions to the Products involving custom or client-specific code (whether created by Tasktop or Customer);
* Software configuration;
* Code required to feed data to Products (feed-related code);
* Project management and training;
* A failure of hardware, equipment or programs not covered by this Agreement; 
* Use of software not obtained from Tasktop under this Agreement; 
* Use in a production environment of any release of the Products not marked as "Generally Available"; 
* Any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of Tasktop (e.g. floods, fires, loss of electricity or other utilities), errors arising from anything other than the Product, such as databases, web-servers or hardware; 
* Customer's failure to comply with operating instructions contained in the Documentation; 
* Any modification, enhancement or customization of the Products made by anyone other than Tasktop;
* APIs, interfaces, web services or data formats other than those included with the Product; or 
* Any third-party products except to the extent that they are provided by Tasktop, and then only in support of the specific interface or functionality that is intended by Tasktop.
