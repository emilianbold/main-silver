        <h2>Mercurial: Select Dialog Box</h2>
                
        <p>The Mercurial Select dialog box enables you to specify which source code location you want
        to use to perform the action associated with the dialog.
        To select a location, choose one of the listed locations in the panel and click Select.
        After you select the location, the IDE will proceed with the action on that clone.
        The other listed locations will not be affected.</p>
        
        <p>This dialog box can appear when you invoke an action from one of the various Mercurial
        dialogs and windows and the IDE identifies that the action will affect multiple
        clone locations, for example when trying to commit changes to two different clones at the same time.
        In this case, you must commit the changes to each of the clones individually.
        </p>
        <p>This can occur if you are working with external libraries (i.e., your project uses a shared
            libraries folder) or components in a freeform project that are separately versioned (i.e.,
            your project has source roots in different disk folders).</p>
