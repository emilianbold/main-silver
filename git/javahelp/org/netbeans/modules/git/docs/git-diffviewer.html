    <h2>Git: Comparing File Revisions</h2>
        
	<p>The IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare 
            revisions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences 
            between the files being compared.</p>
            
	<p>To access the Diff Viewer, select a version-controlled file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files or Favorites window) and choose either Git &gt; Diff from the right-click menu or Team &gt; Git &gt; Diff from the main menu.</p>
        
        <h4>The following table lists the Git commands available in the toolbar of the Diff Viewer:</h4>
