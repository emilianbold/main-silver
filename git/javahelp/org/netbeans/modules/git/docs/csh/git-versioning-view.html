    <h2>Git: Versioning View </h2>
        
	<p>The Git Versioning view provides you with a real-time list of all of the changes made to files within a selected folder of your local working tree. It opens by default in the bottom panel of the IDE, listing added, deleted or modified files.</p>
            
	<p>To open the Versioning view, select a versioned file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and either choose Git &gt; Show Changes from the right-click menu, or choose Team &gt; Git &gt; Show Changes from the main menu. </p>
	<p>By default, the Versioning view displays a list of all modified files within the selected package or folder in your Working Tree.</p>
