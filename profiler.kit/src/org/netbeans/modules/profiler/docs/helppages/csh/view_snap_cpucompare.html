        <h2>CPU Snapshot Comparison</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The CPU Snapshot Comparison window displays a comparison of two CPU snapshots.
        This window opens in the main editor window after you choose the Compare
        Snapshots command from the main menu and select two CPU snapshots.
        Alternatively, you can click the <strong>compute the difference</strong> button
        (&nbsp;<img src="../img/compareSnapshots.png" alt="compute the differences button">&nbsp;)
        in the toolbar of a CPU snapshot.</p>
        
        <p>The window displays a table showing the method call chain and the 
        time spent and the number of invocations for executing threads and methods in each context.
        The IDE compares the two CPU snapshot and 
        displays the differences between the two snapshot in the number of invocations and
        the amount of time spent in invocations. </p>
        
        <p>The comparison that is displayed depends upon the data that is contained in the snapshots. 
        The data that is captured in the snapshot depends upon the options that were selected 
        for the profiling session.</p>
        
        <p>The CPU snapshot comparison window contains the following tabs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Call Tree.</b> This tab displays a call tree showing the method call chain and the time/number
            of invocations for executing threads and methods in each context. </li>
            <li><b>Hot Spots.</b> This tab shows the total execution time and number of
            invocations for each method, irrespective of the context.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can perform the following actions in the CPU snapshot comparison window.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can click the Show or Hide Result Columns button to modify
            the columns that are displayed in the table.</li>
            <li>You can click a column header to sort the order that the results are displayed. </li>
            <li>You can load the source <tt>.java</tt> file of a class by right-clicking in 
            the row for the class and choosing Go To Source.</li>
            <li>You can add a method as a profiling root method by right-clicking in 
            the row for the method and choosing Add to Instrumentation Roots.</li>
            <li>You can filter the list by the name of the method, class or package by typing the filter criteria in the 
            Filter field at the bottom of the window and clicking the filter icon
            (&nbsp;<img src="../img/filter.png" alt="Filter icon">&nbsp;) to selecting a filter option.</li>
        </ul>
