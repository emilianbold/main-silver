        <h2>Analyze Memory: Basic Options</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When analyzing memory usage, you can configure basic and advanced options for the profiling session.
        The following basic options are available when analyzing the lifecycle of objects.
        If you are configuring a custom configuration, click Advanced Settings to specify <a href="csh_memory_options_adv.html">advanced options</a></p>
        <p>When analyzing memory usage, you specify one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quick.</b> 
            When selected, the IDE samples the application to provide data that is limited to the live objects.
            It is not possible to record stack traces or to use profiling points if you select this option.
            This option is less precise than instrumenting methods, but the overhead is lower.
            This option can help you locate methods that you might want to instrument.
            </li>
            <li><b>Advanced.</b> 
            When selected, all of the methods of the profiled application are instrumented if
            you do not specify any root methods. 
            Profiling the application with this option gives you information about the number, type, and 
            location of objects that have been allocated. 
            When this option is selected, all classes that are currently loaded by the 
            target JVM (and each new class as it is loaded) are instrumented 
            to produce information about object allocations.
            You need to select this option if you want to use profiling points when
            analyzing memory usage or if you want to record the call stack.
            This options incurs a greater profiling overhead than choosing the Quick option.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, you can set the following options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Record Full Object Lifestyle.</b> 
            When selected, all information for each object is recorded,
            including the number of generations survived.</li>
        
            <li><b>Record Stack Traces for Allocation.</b>
            When selected, the full call stack is recorded.
            This option enables you to view the reverse call tree for method calls when viewing a memory snapshot.</li>
            <li><b>Use defined Profiling Points.</b> When selected, any actions that are initiated by enabled profiling points 
            in the project are performed. Disabled profiling points are ignored. When deselected, all profiling points in the project
            are ignored.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Overhead bar graph provides you with a rough indication of the overhead that will
        be incurred when you profile the application with the current settings.</p>
