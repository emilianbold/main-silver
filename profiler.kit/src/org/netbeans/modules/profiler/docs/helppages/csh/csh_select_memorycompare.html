        <h2>Select Snapshots to Compare Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Select Snapshots to Compare dialog box enables you to select 
        snapshots that are located on your local system for the purpose of comparing two snapshots.
        Click OK to view a comparison of the snapshots in the Snapshot Comparison window.</p>
        
        <p>You can open this dialog box in the following ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Profile &gt; Compare Snapshots from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Click the Compute the difference button
                (&nbsp;<img src="../img/compareSnapshots.png" alt="compute the differences button">&nbsp;)
                in the toolbar of a CPU or memory snapshot.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you invoke this dialog box from the main menu the dialog box will display two text fields. 
        You need to click the Browse button to locate the two snapshots that you want to compare.</p>
        
        <p>When you invoke this dialog box from an open snapshot you need to select a 
        snapshot to compare to the open snapshot.
        Select one of the following options and then specify a snapshot.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>From Project.</strong> Choose this option to select a snapshot
            that is saved in the project directory. 
            The dialog box displays the snapshots that can be compared to the open snapshot
            and that are located in the default project directory.</li>
            <li><strong>From File.</strong> Choose this option and click Browse to 
            select a snapshot that is saved on your local system.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p><strong>Notes.</strong></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You will see a warning in the dialog box if the snapshots are not the same type.
            When you choose the snapshots that you want to compare, 
            the snapshots must be of the same type and contain similar details
            based on the options that were selected for the profiling session
            when the snapshot was taken.</li>
            <li>When you are locating snapshots in the file browser, 
            the snapshot file type for memory snapshots and CPU snapshots is
            indicated by <tt>.nps</tt> appended to the file name.
            You will not be able to identify the type of snapshot by the file name in the file browser
            if you used the default names that were generated by the IDE  when you saved the snapshots.</li> 
        </ul>
