        <h2>Memory Snapshot Comparison</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Memory Snapshot Comparison window displays a comparison of two memory snapshots.
        This window opens in the main editor window after you choose the Compare Memory
        Snapshots command and select the two memory snapshots.
        Alternatively, you can click the Compare Memory Snapshot button
        in the toolbar of a memory snapshot.</p>
        
        <p>The window displays a table with details about the number of 
        object instances and the amount of memory occupied by the 
        allocated objects at the time the snapshots were taken.
        The IDE compares the two snapshot and for each object 
        displays the changes that occurred between the snapshots. </p>
        
        <p>The comparison that is displayed depends upon the data that is contained in the snapshots. 
        The data that is captured in the snapshot depends upon the options that were selected 
        for the profiling session.</p>
        

        <h3>Allocations Comparison</h3>
        <p>If <b>Record object creation</b> was selected for the profiling session,
        the comparison provides details on the total number of instances.</p>
        
        <p>The table in the Allocations Comparison window contains the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class Name - Live Allocated Objects.</b> Name of the class or allocated object.</li>
            <li><b>Bytes Allocated.</b> Graphic display of the relative amount of memory occupied by instances of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Bytes Allocated.</b> Memory size in bytes occupied by the instances of the class. </li>
            <li><b>Objects Allocated.</b> Number of all instances of the class.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Liveness Comparison</h3>
        <p>If <b>Record both object creation and garbage collection</b> was selected for the profiling session,
        the comparison provides more detailed data on live instances.</p>
                    
        <p>The table in the Liveness Comparison window contains the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class Name - Live Allocated Objects.</b> Name of the class or allocated object.</li>
            <li><b>Live Bytes.</b> Graphic display of the relative amount of memory currently occupied by live instances of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Live Bytes.</b> Memory size in bytes that is currently occupied by the live instances of the class. </li>
            <li><b>Live Objects.</b> Number of current live instances of the class</li>
            <li><b>Allocated Objects.</b> Number of all instances of the class created since the application was started or since the results were last reset.</li>
            <li><b>Average Age.</b> Average age in generations of live instances of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Generations.</b> Number of different generations (garbage collections survived) of live instances of the class.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can perform the following actions in the memory comparison window.</p>
        <ul>
        
            <li>You can click a column header to sort the order that the results are displayed. </li>
            <li>You can load the source <tt>.java</tt> file of a class by right-clicking in 
            the row for the class and choosing Go To Source.</li>
            <li>You can filter the list by the class name by typing the filter criteria in the 
            Class Name Filter at the bottom of the window and clicking the filter icon
            (&nbsp;<img src="../img/filter.png" alt="Filter icon">&nbsp;) to selecting a filter option.</li>
        </ul>
