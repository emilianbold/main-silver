        <h2>Liveness Comparison</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Liveness Comparison window enables you to
        view a comparison of two memory snapshots.
        The Liveness Comparison window opens in the main
        editor window after you choose the Compare Memory
        Snapshots command and select the two memory snapshots.</p>

        <p>The window displays a table that lists the
        live allocated objects at the time the snapshots were taken.
        The IDE compares the two snapshot and for each live object 
        displays the changes that occurred between the
        snapshots in the number of live instances, age and the amount of memory occupied by 
        the live instances.</p>
                    
        <p>The table in the Liveness Comparison window contains the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class Name - Live Allocated Objects.</b> Name of the class or allocated object.</li>
            <li><b>Live Bytes.</b> Graphic display of the relative amount of memory currently occupied by live instances of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Live Bytes.</b> Memory size in bytes that is currently occupied by the live instances of the class. </li>
            <li><b>Live Objects.</b> Number of current live instances of the class</li>
            <li><b>Allocated Objects.</b> Number of all instances of the class created since the application was started or since the results were last reset.</li>
            <li><b>Average Age.</b> Average age in generations of live instances of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Generations.</b> Number of different generations (garbage collections survived) of live instances of the class.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You click a column header to sort the order that the results are displayed. </p>
        <p>You can load the source <tt>.java</tt> file of a class by right-clicking in 
            the row for the class and choosing Go To Source.</p>
        <p>You can filter the list by class name by typing the filter criteria in the 
        Class Name Filter at the bottom of the window. Only classes that contain 
        the filter term will be displayed in the table.</p>
