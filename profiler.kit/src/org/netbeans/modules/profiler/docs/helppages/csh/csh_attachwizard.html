        <h2>Attach Profiler: Attach Settings Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The Attach Wizard helps you configure the settings for profiling an application using the attach method.
        Attach settings are associated with the project.</p>
        
        <p>The Attach Settings dialog box enables you to configure and review the settings 
            for attaching the profiling tool to the application.
        If the settings are correct, do one of the following:</p>

<!--        <ul>
            <li>Click Finish if the application or remote JVM is already configured to accept attachment and you are familiar with the
            instructions.</li>
            <li>Click Next if you are not familiar with how to configure the application or remote JVM to accept attachment.
        The manual integration instructions describe the steps necessary to prepare the application or remote JVM so that you can attach the IDE.</li>
        </ul>-->
        <p>To attach the profiler to an application you first need to specify location of the target JVM by selecting one of the
        following Target options and then performing the steps to </p>
                <ul>    
                    <li><strong>Local.</strong> Select this option if the application is running on the local machine.
                        <p>If you select this option you need to select one of the following Connection options.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dynamic. Connect to a process that is running.</li> 
                            <li>Direct. Select this option if you want the application to start after the profiler attaches. 
                            If you select this option you will need to modify the startup script of the application for standalone
                            Java SE applications. 
                            If you are attaching to a server you will need to modify the startup script and configuration file 
                            of the server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Remote.</strong> Select this option if the application is running on a remote machine.
                        <p>If you select Remote you need to specify the following connection details for the remote host.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hostname. Specify the hostname of the target.</li>
                            <li>OS &amp; JVM. Select the operating system of the target.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After you specify the connection details you need to perform the steps in the dialog box.
                            You will need to start the remote application on a Remote Profiling Pack that the IDE will generate
                            based on the connection details that you specified.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
