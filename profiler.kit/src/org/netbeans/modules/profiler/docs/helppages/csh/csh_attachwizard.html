        <h2>Attach Profiler: Attach Settings Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The Attach Settings dialog box enables you to configure and review the settings for attaching the profiling tool to an application.
        To attach the profiler to an application you need to specify the location of the target JVM 
        and a connection method.
        The attach settings are specific for each project.</p>
        
        <p>You open this dialog box by choosing Profile &gt; Attach Profiler in the main menu
        and then clicking <strong>define</strong> in the Attach Profiler dialog box.</p>
            
        <p>The default setting is to attach to a 
            project running locally using the Dynamic attach method.
            No additional configuration is required to attach the tool to the application
            if you select the default attach setting.
            Specifying other attach settings might require you to modify the startup scripts
            for the application or server or perform additional configuration steps.</p>
            
        <p>In this dialog box you must perform the following steps
            to attach the profiling tool to an application.</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Select Local or Remote as the target JVM.</li>
            <li>Select a connection method and perform
                the configuration steps displayed in the dialog box. Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In this dialog box you can select the following attach setting options.</p>
        <ul>    
            <li><strong>Local.</strong> Select this option if the application is running on the local machine.
                <p>If you select this option you need to select one of the following Connection options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic.</strong> Connect to a process that is running.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Direct.</strong> Select this option if you want the application to start after the profiler attaches. 
                    If you select this option you will need to modify the startup script of the application for standalone
                    Java SE applications. 
                    If you are attaching to a server you will need to modify the startup script and configuration file 
                    of the server.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Remote.</strong> Select this option if the application is running on a remote machine.
                <p>If you select Remote you need to specify the following connection details for the remote host.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hostname.</strong> Specify the hostname of the target.</li>
                    <li><strong>OS &amp; JVM.</strong> Select the operating system of the target.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After you specify the connection details you need to perform the configuration steps in the dialog box.
                    You will need to start the remote application on a Remote Profiling Pack that the IDE will generate
                    based on the connection details that you specified.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Using the Remote Profiling Pack</h3>
        <p>To attach the profiling tool to an application that is running on a remote JVM you
        need to configure the remote JVM to start up using a remote profiling pack.
        The remote profiling pack is a collection of libraries that will enable the profiling
        tool to attach to the remote JVM.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select Remote for the target JVM in the Attach Settings dialog box.</li>
            <li>Specify the OS and JVM of the target JVM.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>create a Remote Profiling Pack</strong> in the dialog box.</li>
            <li>Save the remote profiling pack to your local system.</li>
            <li>Expand the zip archive and copy the files to the remote system.</li>
            <li>Modify the startup script of the remote system to use the profiling pack.</li>
        </ol>
