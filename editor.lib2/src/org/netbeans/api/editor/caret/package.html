  <p>
  The Editor Caret API opens up the editor to give information about its carets
  and to manipulate them.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Key parts of the API</h3>
  
  <p>
  The whole API is organized around the
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/api/editor/caret/EditorCaret.html">EditorCaret</a></code>
  class, an implementation of the <code>javax.swing.text.Caret</code> managing
  all the carets in a single document. Information about carets maintained by
  <code>EditorCaret</code> is stored in the immutable class
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/api/editor/caret/CaretInfo.html">CaretInfo</a></code>.
  Once a caret gets mutated its corresponding caret info becomes obsolete
  and new caret info instance gets created lazily.
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/api/editor/caret/EditorCaretListener.html">EditorCaretListener</a></code>
  can be registered to an <code>EditorCaret</code> to be informed about caret
  addition/removal or movement with an
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/api/editor/caret/EditorCaretEvent.html">EditorCaretEvent</a></code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The <code>EditorCaret</code> mutates its carets in a single transaction.
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/api/editor/caret/CaretMoveContext.html">CaretMoveContext</a></code>
  allows clients implementing
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/caret/CaretMoveHandler.html">CaretMoveHandler</a></code>
  to manipulate carets. The following code shows how all carets are moved to the
  end of the word they are currently on.
  
  <pre><code>
    editorCaret.moveCarets((CaretMoveContext context) -> {
        for (CaretInfo ci : context.getOriginalCarets()) {
            Position pos = target.getDocument().createPosition(Utilities.getWordEnd(target, ci.getDot()));
            context.setDot(ci, pos);
        }
    });
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Locking and <code>Document</code> changes</h3>
  
  <p>
  The basics of the locking and events model of Swing documents is
  described in the javadoc of the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/swing/text/AbstractDocument.html">javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument</a>
  class. Netbeans documents use the same patterns and so does the Caret API,
  because of its tight relation to documents. The fundamentals of the Swing documents
  locking model are that any changes to a document are done under the
  document's write lock, the document's listeners are notified synchronously on the
  mutating thread and have full read access to the document, but can't modify it.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
    Any calls from the infrastructure to <code>EditorCaret</code> to query or
    mutate its carets, should be called with document's read-lock acquired which
    will guarantee stability of <code>CaretInfo#getDot()</code> and
    <code>CaretInfo#getMark()</code> and prevent caret merging as a possible
    effect of document modifications.
    </li>
    <li>
    When <code>EditorCaret</code> needs to notify its listeners that some
    of its carets have changed, all the events have to be fired under the
    layer's document's read lock. Obviously, the listeners are not allowed to
    modify the document from the event notification methods.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The Caret API does not use any special threads and any processing it
  does is always done on the caller's thread. This means that the above described
  constraints hardly cause any limitation for practical use.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The Caret API is generally thread-safe meaning that it can be used
  simultaneously from multiple threads if not stated otherwise. This doesn't
  change in any way the rule of acquiring a read lock before calling the API.
  Swing documents generally allow access for multiple readers that can run
  concurrently.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="compatibilty">Backwards compatibility</a></h3>
  <p>
  As a technical limitation, <code>EditorCaret</code> has to implement <code>Caret</code>
  to be able to work with Swings Text API. The <code>Caret</code> interface is not
  aware of multiple carets and any call to its method will work on the last added
  caret. Manipulating the caret using <code>setDot(int)</code> or <code>moveDot(int)</code>
  will retain only the last added caret and move it accordingly.
  <br>
  <code>editorTextComponent.getCaret()</code> will now always return <code>EditorCaret</code>
  instance instead of the original caret implementation <code>org.netbeans.editor.BaseCaret</code>.
  Since clients were expected to only rely on <code>javax.swing.text.Caret</code> returned type
  (except internal code in editor modules) they should not be affected by the change
  since <code>EditorCaret</code> implements <code>Caret</code> interface.
  <br>
  With official Caret API the clients can start to cast
  <code>editorTextComponent.getCaret()</code> to <code>EditorCaret</code> type
  and use its extended functionality.
  </p>
