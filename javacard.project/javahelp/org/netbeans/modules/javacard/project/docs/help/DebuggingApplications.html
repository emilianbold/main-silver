  </script></head><body class="body"><a name="DebuggingApplications"></a><h2>Debugging Applications</h2>
<p class="p">The Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) used by the IDE is heavy for
a small VM such as that provided by cjcre. Consequently, cjcre uses
KVM Debug Wire Protocol (KDWP) to provide a minimum set of debugging capabilities. The
debugproxy translates and sends the translated JDWP commands from the IDE to cjcre
in KDWP format. Responses from cjcre are converted into JDWP format by debugproxy
before it sends them to the IDE. </p><p class="p">The communication between cjcre, debugproxy, and the IDE happens through sockets. Socket based
communication enables developers to debug cjcre from remote hosts. For example, cjcre could
run on machine1, debugproxy could run on machine2, and the IDE could run
on machine3. Developers can also run cjcre, debugproxy, and the IDE on same
host.</p><p class="p">Ports used by IDE communication to and from debugproxy and debugproxy communication to
and from cjcre are distinguished by the names &#8220;listen port&#8221; and &#8220;remote
port&#8221; respectively.</p>
