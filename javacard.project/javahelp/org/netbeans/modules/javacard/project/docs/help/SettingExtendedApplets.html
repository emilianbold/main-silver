<p class="p">The Applets panel displays the name, number of instances, and AID of each
extended applet that will be included in <tt>applet.xml</tt>. The Applets panel enables you
to <a href="RemoveExtendedApplet.html">Remove an Extended Applet</a> from the list of applets included in the <tt>applet.xml</tt> file and, for
instances of an enabled applet, <a href="RemoveInstanceExtendedApplet.html">Remove an Instance of an Extended Applet</a>, <a href="AddInstanceExtendedApplet.html">Add an Instance of an Extended Applet </a>, edit deployment parameters, and <a href="EditAIDofExtendedApplet.html">Edit an AID of an Extended Applet</a>.</p><p class="p">You can customize instance of an applet by adding and removing multiple instances
of an applet deployed to a card. Each instance must have a unique
AID that scripts can use when communicating with an instance of an applet.
The instance AID follows the form of but does not have to be
related to the applet AID. </p><p class="p">Separate instance of an applet can have different deployment parameters. These parameters are
passed to the applet instance when it is instantiated on the card.</p><p class="p"><b>Related Information</b></p>
