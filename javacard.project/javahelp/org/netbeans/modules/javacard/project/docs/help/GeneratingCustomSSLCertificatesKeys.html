<p class="p">If you create and deploy a custom Java Card 3 client-server implementation, you
must also generate a corresponding set of custom SSL certificates and keys. These
certificates and keys are used by the Card Manager to verify the digital
signature of WAR file. </p><p class="p">Use the command line procedure and commands to generate SSL certificates and keys.
If you have installed the NetBeans Run Terminal plugin, you can choose Tools
&#62; Run Terminal in the main window of the IDE to open a
terminal and then enter the commands to generate these certificates and keys.</p><p class="p">See the <i>Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide, Java Card Platform, Version 3.0.1 Connected Editon</i> for the command line procedures and commands.</p>
