<p class="p">When you install the Java Card Runtime Bundle plugin, it automatically sets up
a default Java Card 3 platform and associated default device in the IDE.
Before working in the IDE to create a Java Card platform application you
might want to verify that the platform is set up for your use.
To verify that the platform is set up correctly, see <a href="z400000b1395278.html">Verify the Java Card Platform is Set Up</a>.</p>
<p class="p">If you use a different or a custom Java Card platform that you
want to create appliations for, you must add it to the IDE. See
<a href="z400000b1395512.html">Add a Java Card Platform</a>. If you create applications to run on a device with different settings
than those of the default device, you must add a new device or
customize the existing device with the appropriate settings. See <a href="z400000b1395378.html">Add a New Device</a> or <a href="cjcjcdag.html">Customize a Device</a>.</p>
