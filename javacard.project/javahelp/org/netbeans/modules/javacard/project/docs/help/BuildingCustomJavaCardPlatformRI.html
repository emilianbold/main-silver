<p class="p">Developers can modify the RI by adding or modifying the reference implementation code
and using the ROMizer tool. RI consists of <tt>.java</tt> and C source files.
The core VM is written in C programming language with the remainder of
the API and supported implementation written in the Java programming language. The ROMizer
tool converts the class files into C code (often called the ROM mask
or simply the mask). Then all C source code is compiled to an
executable to generate the <tt>custom RI.</tt>See the <i>Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide, Java Card 3 Platform Connected Edition</i> for a detailed description of and procedures
for building a custom RI.</p>
