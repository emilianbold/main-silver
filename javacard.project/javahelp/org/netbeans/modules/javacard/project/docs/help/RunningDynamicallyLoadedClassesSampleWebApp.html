<a name="RunningDynamicallyLoadedClassesSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> sample demonstrates dynamic class loading using the <tt>Class.forName()</tt> method. The sample contains
one web application that displays a web form enabling the user to enter
a text string and to select a greeting type from a dropdown list.
The application displays a text string that concatenates the greeting type with the
text string entered by the user.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt>
project, starting the application, entering text in the web page Name field, and clicking
the Greet button to display the greeting page.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> project is located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web</tt> folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the <i>Java Card 3 Platform Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide</i> for additional details including screen captures.</p>

<li class="li"><b>Go to the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web </tt>folder and open the <tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> project.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs the
IDE launches the default browser and displays the Dynamically Loaded Classes page.</p></li>
