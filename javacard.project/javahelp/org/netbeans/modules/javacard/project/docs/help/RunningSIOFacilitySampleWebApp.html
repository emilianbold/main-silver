<a name="RunningSIOFacilitySampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>SIOFacility</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>SIOFacility</tt> sample demonstrates inter-application communication using shared interface objects (SIOs). One servlet updates
a shared object while the other can read updated values.This sample contains two
web applications that demonstrate inter-application communication using SIOs. </p><p class="p">Running the <tt>SIOFacility</tt> sample consists of using the using the IDE to open
the <tt>SIOservice</tt> and the <tt>SIOclient</tt> projects, starting both the <tt>SIOservice</tt> and <tt>SIOclient</tt> applications, entering
values in the SIO Service web page, clicking the Set Value button on
the page, and then using a hyperlink on the SIO page to display
a list of received events.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>SIOservice</tt> and the <tt>SIOclient</tt> projects are located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web\SIOFacility</tt> folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the <i>Java Card 3 Platform Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide</i> for additional details including screen captures.</p>

<li class="li"><b>Go to the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web\RestartableTasks </tt>folder and open the <tt>SIOservice</tt> and the <tt>SIOclient</tt> projects.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select the <tt>SIOservice</tt> project and click the run button in the main window.
</b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the <tt>SIOservice</tt> application. When the application runs,
