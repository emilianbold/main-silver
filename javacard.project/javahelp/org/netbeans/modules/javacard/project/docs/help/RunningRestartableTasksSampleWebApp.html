<a name="RunningRestartableTasksSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>RestartableTasks</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>RestartableTasks</tt> sample demonstrates how a registered task can be automatically available after the
card is reset. The sample registers a task that serves data via an
HTTP connection to the client.This sample contains two web applications, <tt>InfoClient</tt> and <tt>InfoServer</tt>, that
demonstrate a registered task that is available after the card is reset.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>RestartableTasks</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>InfoClient</tt>
and the <tt>InfoServer</tt> projects, starting the <tt>InfoClient</tt> and <tt>InfoServer</tt> applications, and clicking the Register
Ping Service hyperlink to display the JCPingServer page. The server is stopped and
restarted and the JCPingServer page is displayed.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>InfoClient</tt> and the <tt>InfoServer</tt><tt></tt> projects are located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web\RestartableTasks</tt> folder.</p>
