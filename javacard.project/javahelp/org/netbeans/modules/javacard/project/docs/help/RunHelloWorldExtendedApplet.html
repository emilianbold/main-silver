  </title>

<body class="body">



<a name="RunHelloWorldExtendedApplet"></a><h2>Run <tt>HelloWorld</tt> Extended Applet</h2><p class="p">This <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample demonstrates the basic structure of a Java Card 3 platform
extended applet that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload
extended applets. It is a minimal extended applet utilizing the simplest source code
and meta-files. This sample contains one project that demonstrates the function of an
extended applet.</p><p class="p">Running the sample consists of using the IDE to start the <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
extended applet. When running, the project installs the extended applet, processes an incoming APDU,
and responds with a text greeting.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> project is located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\extended_applets</tt> folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the <i>Java Card 3 Platform Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide</i> for additional details including screen captures.</p>

<li class="li"><b>Go to the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\extended_applets </tt>folder and open the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> project.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs, it
creates an output file.</p></li>
<li class="li"><b>Verify that the contents of the output file are the same as the
contents of the <tt>HelloWorld.expected.out</tt> file.</b></li></ol>
