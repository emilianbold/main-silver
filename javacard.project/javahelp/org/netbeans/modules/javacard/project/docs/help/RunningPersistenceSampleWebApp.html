<body class="body">



<a name="RunningPersistenceSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>Persistence</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>Persistence</tt> sample demonstrates the persistence of user entered information when a session
on a card is resumed. The sample stores user-entered information as history and, when
the card resumes functioning, the previous entries are made available.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>Persistence</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>Persistence</tt>
project, starting the application, clicking the hyperlink on the Persistence web page to open
the database form, using the form to add and delete items in the
database list, and stopping and restarting the server. When the server is stopped
and restarted the items in the list should not change.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>Persistence</tt> project is located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web</tt> folder.</p>

<li class="li"><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs the
IDE launches the default browser and displays the Persistence page.</p></li>
