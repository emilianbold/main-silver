<a name="AppletsPanel"></a><h2>Applets Panel</h2>
<p class="p">The Applets panel is only provided for classic applet and extended applet projects.
The Applets panel displays the name, number of instances, and AID of each
applet that will be included in <tt>applet.xml</tt>. The Applets panel enables you to
remove a classic applet from the list of applets included in the <tt>applet.xml</tt>
file and to customize the instances of an enabled classic applet by adding additional
instances of the applet, editing deployment parameters, and editing the instance AID of
the applet.</p><p class="p">You can customize instance of an applet by adding and removing multiple instances
of an applet deployed to a card. Each instance must have a unique
AID that scripts can use when communicating with an instance of an applet.
The instance AID follows the form of but does not have to be
related to the applet AID. </p><p class="p">Separate instance of an applet can have different deployment parameters. These parameters are
passed to the applet instance when it is instantiated on the card.</p>
