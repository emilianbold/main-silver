<a name="RunningDynamicSecureWebHostingSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> sample demonstrates secure hosting with user access on a dynamic port. The
sample contains one web application that accesses a secure website hosted on a
dynamic port determined by the Java Card 3 platform. Each time the application
is run, the Java Card 3 platform determines the port used to access
the website.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt>
project, starting the application, checking the website&#8217;s security certificate, displaying a web page, and
entering information on that page.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Edition
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> project is located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web</tt> folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the <i>Java Card 3 Platform Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide</i> for additional details including screen captures.</p>
<hr>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="li"><b>Click File &#62; Open Project in the main window.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Go to the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web </tt>folder and open the <tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> project.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs, the
IDE launches the default browser and displays the Secure hosting dynamic port entry
page.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>If the browser displays a warning that the security certificate is not issued
by a trusted certificate authority, disregard it and continue to the web site.
The security certificate for this sample is used for demonstration purposes only and
cannot be used for developing deployable samples.If you are unable to continue to the
web page, perform <a href="AcceptingUntrustedCertificates.html">Accepting Untrusted Certificates</a>.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li class="li"><b>Enter text in the name field and click the Say Hello button.</b><p class="p">The browser displays a greeting page that uses the text entered in the
name field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><b>Close the browser to stop the application.</b></li></ol>
