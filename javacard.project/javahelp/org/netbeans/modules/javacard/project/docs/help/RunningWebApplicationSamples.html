  <title>Run HelloWorld Web Application Sample - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="RunningWebApplicationSamples"></a><h2>Run <tt>HelloWorld</tt> Web Application Sample</h2>
   p>This <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample demonstrates the basic structure of a Java Card 3 platform
application that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload a
stand-alone module. It is a minimal application utilizing the simplest source code and
meta-files. The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample contains one web application that demonstrates
using a basic
web form to collect and display information provided by the user.</p>
<p>Running the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
project, starting the HelloWorld application, entering a name in a web page, clicking the
Say Hello button on the page, and then displaying a greeting.</p>
<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, either download and install the Java Card 3
Development Kit, Connected Edition on your development system or download the sample from
the Kenai Java Card 3 repository. See <a href="GetAdditionalWebAppSamples.html">Getting Additional Web Application Samples</a> for instructions required to download samples
from the Kenai Java Card 3 repository.</p>
