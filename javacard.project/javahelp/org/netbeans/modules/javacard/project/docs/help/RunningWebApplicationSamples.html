<a name="RunningWebApplicationSamples"></a><h3 class="h3">Running Web and Reference Application Samples</h3>
<p class="p">The following topics describe how to run the web and reference application samples
provided in the Java Card 3 Development Kit. The samples demonstrate the features
of the Java Card API, Connected Edition and include simple web applications and
a reference application. </p><p class="p">The following list describes the simple web application samples located in the JC_CONNECTED_HOME\samples\web
folder and presents them in an order that is based on increasing complexity
(the simplest <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample is listed first and the more complex <tt>CardHolderAuthorization</tt> sample listed
last):</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b><b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b> represents the directory in which the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected
Edition was installed.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>HelloWorld</tt> - Demonstrates the basic structure of a Java Card 3 platform application that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload a stand-alone module. It is a minimal application utilizing the simplest source code and meta-files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>ContainerManagedAuthentication</tt> - Demonstrates basic web container authentication with a PIN authenticator using JC-FORM with Biometric password.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>StaticSecureWebHosting</tt> - Demonstrates secure hosting on a static port.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>DynamicSecureWebHosting</tt> - Demonstrates secure hosting on a dynamic port.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>GCFClient</tt> -Demonstrates the Generic Connection Framework (GCF) functionality of a http client, a socket client, and a socket server.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>DynamicallyLoadedClasses</tt> - Demonstrates dynamic class loading using the <tt>Class.forName()</tt> method.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>Persistence</tt> - Demonstrates the persistence of user entered information when a session on a card is resumed.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>RestartableTasks</tt> - Demonstrates how a registered task can be automatically available after the card is reset.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>Transactions</tt> - Demonstrates transaction types and functions.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>SIOFacility</tt> - Demonstrates <tt>isCLientInRole()</tt> usage and usage of the transferable API.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>EventFacility</tt> - Demonstrates a servlet that registers a listener for events and a servlet that enables users to fire custom events.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>CardHolderAuthorization</tt> - Demonstrates a remote client unable to access a resource and a card holder authorizing a second servlet to enable access by the remote client.</p></li></ul>
<p class="p">The reference application sample, <tt>Transit</tt>,is located in the JC_CONNECTED_HOME\ samples\reference_apps folder and is a
blue print-like sample application that demonstrates the interactions between various applications on the
card using advanced features such as SIO and events. The reference application illustrates the
use of the Java Card API, scenarios of package masking, and post-manufacture installation.</p>

Card 3 platform.</p>
