   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="SettingExtensionLibDependencies"></a><h2>Setting Extension Library Dependencies</h2>
<p class="p">The Dependencies panel displays the extension libraries, their paths, and deployment strategies in
the project as well as enables you to <a href="AddExtensionLibrary.html">Add an Extension Library</a>, <a href="RemoveExtensionLibrary.html">Remove an Extension Library</a>, change the order
of libraries and <a href="ChangeExtensionLibDeployment.html">Change an Extension Library Deployment Strategy</a> used in the project.</p><p class="p"><b>Libraries</b> - If you want to use the same set of sources in
multiple projects, you can set it in the project as an extension library
and share it among different users and projects as a separate project. There
are two types of extension libraries that can be added to a project:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing extension library projects. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing extension library JAR files. </p><p class="p">Use an extension library that depends on a JAR file when the JAR file satisfies one of the following conditions: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file represents an API that resides on the target platform but is not deployed.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file contains classes that must be included in the JAR file generated for the project.</p></li></ul>
