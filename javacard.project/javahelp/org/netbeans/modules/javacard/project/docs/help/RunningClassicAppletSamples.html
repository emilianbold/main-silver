<p class="p">The following topic describes how to run the classic applet sample, <tt>ClassicChannels</tt>, provided
in the Java Card 3 Development Kit. The sample demonstrates the features of the
Java Card API, Connected Edition, scenarios of package masking, and post-manufacture installation.</p><p class="p">The <tt>ClassicChannels</tt> sample demonstrates the behavior of Java Card technology-based logical channels by
showing how two applets that interact with each other can each be selected for
use at the same time.</p><p class="p">The applets may use a contact or contactless interface for communication with the
terminal. The <tt>ClassicChannels</tt> sample demonstrates the selection of an applet on both interfaces.
The sample also demonstrates use of ExtendedLength APDU.</p><p class="p">While it is connected, the user&#8217;s account is debited on a unit of
time basis. The debit rate is based on whether the connection is local
or remote, and uses either the contacted or contactless interface.</p><p class="p">The sample employs two applets to simulate the behavior of logical channels:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The <tt>ConnectionManager</tt> applet manages the connection.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><tt>AccountAccessor</tt> applet manages the account.</p></li></ul>
<p class="p">When the user turns on the device, the <tt>ConnectionManager</tt> applet is selected. The
<tt>ConnectionManager</tt> implements the <tt>ExtendedLength</tt> interface to handle APDUs with larger data segments such as
the ones used for key exchange in the sample. Every unit of time
the terminal sends a message containing the area code to the card.</p><p class="p">When the user wants to use the service, the <tt>AccountAccessor</tt> applet is selected
on another logical channel so that the terminal can query the balance. The
<tt>AccountAccessor</tt> can return the balance only if the <tt>ConnectionManager</tt> is active. The <tt>ConnectionManager</tt> applet
sets the connection and tracks the connection status. Based on the value of
an area code variable, the <tt>ConnectionManager</tt> determines whether the connection is local or remote.
It also determines whether the connection is contacted or contactless. <tt>AccountAccessor</tt> uses this information
to debit the account at the appropriate rate. The connection is disabled when
the user completes the call or when the account is depleted.</p><p class="p">The <tt>ClassicChannels</tt> sample is located in the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b>\<tt>samples\classic_applets </tt>folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b><b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b> represents the directory in which the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected
Edition was installed.</p>
