  <title>Setting Up Security for Your Project - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="SettingUpSecurityForWebApplication"></a><h2>Setting Up Security for Your Project</h2>
<p class="p">The Java Card 3 platform uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide security
for applications by encrypting and decrypting data. An SSL implementation needs four algorithms,
digital signature, key establishment, bulk encryption, and message digest. </p><p class="p">The Java Card 3 platform implements the SSL key establishment algorithm through the
use of a set of certificates and keys as <b>key</b>=<b>value</b> pairs specified in
the <tt>config.properties</tt> file.</p><p class="p">You do not have to set up security when running samples provided with
the plugin or the Java Card 3 Kenai project site. The plugins provide a default <tt>config.properties</tt> file that is used when
running the sample projects.</p>
<p>See the appropriate Java Card 3 platform documentation on the Java Card 3 Kenai project site for detailed information about setting up security for a project.</p>
