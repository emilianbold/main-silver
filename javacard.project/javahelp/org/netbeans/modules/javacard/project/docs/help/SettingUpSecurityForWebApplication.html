  <title>Setting Up Security for Your Project - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="SettingUpSecurityForWebApplication"></a><h2>Setting Up Security for Your Project</h2>
<p class="p">The Java Card 3 platform uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide security
for applications by encrypting and decrypting data. An SSL implementation needs four algorithms,
digital signature, key establishment, bulk encryption, and message digest. </p><p class="p">The Java Card 3 platform implements the SSL key establishment algorithm through the
use of a set of certificates and keys as <b>key</b>=<b>value</b> pairs specified in
the <tt>config.properties</tt> file.</p><p class="p">You do not have to set up security when running samples provided with
the plugin. The plugins provide a default <tt>config.properties</tt> file that is used when
running the sample projects. However, custom implementations that use SSL require that you
generate corresponding custom certificates and keys and add them to the implementation&#39;s <tt>config.properties</tt>
file. See <a href="CustomizingJavaCardPlatform.html">Customizing a Java Card Platform</a> if you are creating and deploying a custom Java Card 3 client-server implementation. Unless your custom SSL certificates and keys are issued by a valid certificate
authority they will be treated by the client application as untrusted certificates. To
successfully run your client-server application with your custom SSL certificates and keys, you must
add your certificate to the browser&#39;s list of accepted certificates.</p>
<p>See the appropriate Java Card 3 platform documentation on the Java Card 3 Kenai project site for detailed information about setting up security for a project.</p>
