<a name="RunningGCFClientSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>GCFClient</tt> Sample Web Application</h2><p class="p">The <tt>GCFClient</tt> sample demonstrates the Generic Connection Framework (GCF) functionality.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>GCFClient</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>GCFClient</tt>
project, starting the application, entering a URL (such as http://www.sun.com) in the URL field,
and then clicking the Get Content button on the page to display the
contents of the web page.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Editon
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>GCFClient</tt> project is located under the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web</tt> folder.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the <i>Java Card 3 Platform Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide</i> for additional details including screen captures.</p>

<li class="li"><b>Go to the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web </tt>folder and open the <tt>GCFClient</tt> project.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p class="p">The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs the
IDE launches the default browser and displays the GCF Client Page.</p></li>

a full form (such as <a href="http://www.sun.com">http://www.sun.com</a>). The sample does not work when the
URL is provided in an abbreviated form (such as www.sun.com).</p>
