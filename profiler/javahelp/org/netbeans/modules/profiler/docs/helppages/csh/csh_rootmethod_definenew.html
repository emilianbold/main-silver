        <h2>Analyze Performance: Define New Profiling Root</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When analyzing application performance, you can choose to limit the source code that is instrumented by 
        specifying a root method. When you profile an application by instrumenting a root method, profiling data 
        is collected when one of the application's threads enters and leaves the root method.</p>
                
        <p>The Define New Profiling Root dialog box enables you to specify a method and the class 
        that contains the method. 
        You can also edit an existing root method.
        You open this dialog box from the Edit Profiling Roots (Advanced) dialog box
        by clicking Add or by selecting a root method and clicking Edit.
        </p>

        <p>To define the profiling root you need to specify the following details.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class Name.</b> The name of the class that contains the method.</li>
            <li><b>Method Name.</b> The name of the method.</li>
            <li><b>Method VM Signature.</b> The signature of the method in VM format.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you click OK, the method is added to the list of root methods that are 
        associated with that profiling configuration.</p>

        
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You may need to first mount the file system or a JAR file that contains your root
            method's class, e.g. if this class does not belong to your application's
            classpath. That is the case, for example, when profiling code running on
            top of a Web/Java EE server.</li>
            <li>If you choose a given method as a root when a thread is already 
            executing it, profiling will not start. To begin profiling, a "fresh" call 
            to the root method is required.
            Once partial application profiling is initiated, profiling data 
            is not collected until one of the application's threads enters the profiling root method.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you click OK the root method is added to the list of root methods displayed in the 
        Specify Root Method dialog box.
        You can select a method from the list and click Remove to delete the method from the list.</p>
