#issues descriptions
FunctionUsageAudit.gets.description=This function does not check for bounds while storing the input. This function can't be used securely.

FunctionUsageAudit.cftime.description=These routines do no bounds checking on the output buffer and may import user-data through the environment variable CFTIME

FunctionUsageAudit.strcat.description=It is not possible to limit these functions to a maximum buffer size.\n\
    The use of these functions will always force reviewers to follow the logic, and prevent automated scanning of source code for vulnerabilities.

FunctionUsageAudit.access.description=This function is useless because the information it provides is outdated by the time you get to use it.\n\
    Using access() followed by open() has a race condition that can't be solved.

FunctionUsageAudit.strncat.description=strncat() is hard to use as it requires the proper size of the destination buffer to be calculated

FunctionUsageAudit.strncpy.description=strncpy() is not guaranteed to null-terminate the destination buffer.

FunctionUsageAudit.chmod.description=These functions operate on pathnames and are prone to race conditions. \n\
    Normally, programs shouldn't need to call chown/chmod but honor the current uid (switch back to it before opening files.) and umask.

FunctionUsageAudit.alloca.description=Does not check if the returned pointer is within the stack bounds -\n\
    and for memory allocations larger than a page may jump over stack guard page into other allocated pages and overwrite them.
