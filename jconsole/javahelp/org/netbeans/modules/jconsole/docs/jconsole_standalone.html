<h2>JConsole Management Console</h2>
JConsole is a JMX-compliant GUI tool that connects to a running JVM and
displays some JVM metrics, as well as the set of living MBeans.<br>
JConsole is tightly integrated with a Java Application type of Project.
<br>
<br>
For other types of project, JConsole can also be useful to visualize
your management.<br>
<br>
<p>To launch the JConsole management console from any kind of project :
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Run/Start
JConsole... </span> menu item<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></li>
  <li>JConsole is displayed.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
To configure the JConsole management console : <br>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <span style="font-style: italic;">Options/Miscellaneous/JConsole</span></li>
  <li>Update the JConsole properties.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Using JConsole to visualize your MBeans</h2>
Once JConsole is displayed :<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">MBeans</span> Tab to
visualize your
MBean (located under <span style="font-style: italic;">DefaultDomain</span>
Tree node).</li>
  <li>Select an MBean. Its Attributes, operations and a notification
buffer are displayed on the right frame. <br>
  </li>
  <li>To set Attributes, type directly in the Attributes value
column.</li>
  <li>To call Operations, select the <span style="font-style: italic;">Operations</span>
tab. Type your inputs in the dedicated TextField. Click on the operation
name button.<br>
  </li>
  <li>To register for notifications, select the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Notifications</span> Tab then the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Subscribe</span> button.</li>
  <li>You can visualize other information by selecting the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Info</span> tab.</li>
</ol>
