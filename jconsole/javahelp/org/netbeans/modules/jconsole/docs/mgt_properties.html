<h2>Management Property File Wizard<br>
</h2>
This wizard allows you to generate a management configuration file.
This file is a standard Java property file.<br>
When launching a JDK 5.0 JVM, you can provide a management property
file using the following System property<br>
<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">-Dcom.sun.management.config.file=&lt;path to managemenet properties file&gt;</pre>
<br>
To Access the wizard :<br>
<ol>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">File/New File...</span></li>
  <li>Select the <span style="font-style: italic;">JMX </span>category.
In <span style="font-style: italic;">File Types</span> select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Management Properties File<br>
    </span></li>
  <li>Type in a <span style="font-style: italic;">Name</span> and a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Location</span>. Two more files will be
generated: an access file and a password file that contain the RMI authentication
configuration.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Click <span style="font-style: italic;">Next&gt;</span></li>
  <li>Type in RMI related information. You can set an RMI Port, enable
RMI Authentication, add Roles and Passwords, Enable SSL.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li>Click <span style="font-style: italic;">Next&gt;</span></li>
  <li>You can enable SNMP and type in a UDP
port, an SNMP interface, a trap port, enable Access Control, and set a
custom ACL file.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Click <span style="font-style: italic;">Next&gt;</span></li>
  <li>You can then enable
thread contention monitoring.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Finish&gt; </span>A popup
window informs you to restrict access to the password file. You have to
change
the generated .password file access. It must be readable for you only
(On Unix systems : -rw-------). If you don't change the access, and you
enable RMI Authentication, the
Agent will not start.</li>
  <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
  </span>
</ol>
Three files are generated in the selected location. You can use the
generated properties file when running the Main Project with Remote
Management (from menu <span style="font-style: italic;">Run/Management/Run(orDebug)
Main Project with Remote Management...</span>).<span
