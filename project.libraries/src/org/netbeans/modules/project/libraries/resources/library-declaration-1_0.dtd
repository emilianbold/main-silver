  Root element of library definition descriptor.

<!ELEMENT library (name, type, description?, localizing-bundle?, volume*) >

<!-- The version attribute specifies the version of the library -->
<!ATTLIST library version CDATA #FIXED "1.0" >

<!--- Library unique identifier - a string.
 In the case when the localizing-bundle element presents the name value is used 
 as a key into bundle to locate the display name. Otherwise the name value is 
 used as a display name-->
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA) >

<!--Short description of given library - a string.
 In the case when the localizing-bundle element presents the description value
 is used as a key into bundle to locate the localized description. Otherwise
 the description value is used.-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA) >

<!-- The resource name of base bundle without an extension - a string.
 The bundle used to lookup the localized strings.
 The bundle is looked up by NbBundle.getBundle (String) method.
 Example of localizing bundle: org.netbeans.modules.junit.resources.Bundle -->
<!ELEMENT localizing-bundle (#PCDATA)>

<!--- Volume is typed list of resources -->
<!ELEMENT volume (type, resource*) >

<!--- Volume type of a library volume - a string 
 For example the J2SE library supports the following types of volume:
 classpath, javadoc and src -->
<!ELEMENT type (#PCDATA) >

<!--- Volume resource coded as absolute URI.
 Example:
 file:/usr/lib/java/xerces.jar is resolved to /usr/lib/java/xerces.jar
 nbinst:/modules/ext/junit.jar is resolved to /IDE-INSTALLATION/ide/modules/ext/junit.jar
