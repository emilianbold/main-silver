<h2>Sending MBean Notifications</h2>
An MBean can send notifications in any part of its implementation
(Attributes, Operations, non-exposed methods, etc.)<br>
This chapter shows the&nbsp; things to do to send a
notification when an attribute is set.<br>
The code extract is based on an MBean that has been updated with JMX
Notification support (delegation to a notification broadcaster and
 generation of sequence number handling). This can be done using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">JMX MBean Wizard</span> or using <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the action to update an existing MBean</span>
(See the Updating Existing MBeans chapter).<br>
<br>
<h2>Adding Code to Send Attribute Change Notifications
</h2>
In the editor, select the <span style="font-style: italic;">set&lt;MyAttribute&gt;</span>
method name. After your attribute is set, add the following code: <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">//Send a
notification when the
attribute is set</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Notification n =
new
Notification(AttributeChangeNotification.ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE, this,
getNextSeqNumber());<br>
broadcaster.sendNotification(n);</span><br>
