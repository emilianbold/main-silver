<h2>Writing a JMX Agent</h2>
<br>
This chapter demonstrates the use of the Agent Wizard. Part of the 
information contained here can be applied to any Java application.<br>
<br>
Any application that registers MBeans within an MBeanServer is a JMX
Agent.<br>
You can locally access the platform's MBeanServer by calling <span
 style="font-style: italic;">java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer()<br>.
</span>Once you get a reference to the MBeanServer you can then
register your MBeans.<br>
<br>
