<h2>JMX Technology and J2SE 5.0</h2>
J2SE 5.0 has implemented version 1.2 of the JMX specification and
version 1.0 of the <a
 href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr160/index.html">JMX
Remote API (JSR 160)</a> specification. J2SE 5.0 includes significant
monitoring and management features, including:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>JVM instrumentation:</b> The JVM is instrumented for
monitoring and management providing built-in, out-of-the-box management
capabilities for local and remote access.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Monitoring and Management APIs:</b> The <code>java.lang.management</code>
package provides the interface for monitoring and managing the JVM. It
provides access to information such as: the number of classes loaded and
threads running, memory consumption, garbage collection statistics,
on-demand deadlock detection, and others.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Management tools</b> such as <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/jconsole.html">JConsole</a>,
which is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool that comes with J2SE 5.0. It
uses JMX instrumentation of the JVM to provide information on
performance and resource consumption of applications running on the
Java platform.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The core classes for the JMX implementation are provided in the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/management/package-summary.html#package_description"><code>javax.management</code></a>
package. In addition, the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/management/package-summary.html#package_description"><code>java.lang.management</code></a>
package provides the mangagement interface for monitoring and
management of the JVM as well as the operating system on which the JVM
is running.
</p>
<p>
To enable the JMX agent and configure its operation using <code>jconsole</code>,
you must set some specific system properties when you start the JVM.
For local access, set the property <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote</code>
as follows when starting the JVM:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>prompt&gt;</b> <code>java
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote AppName</code>
</p>
<p>And, to enable monitoring and management from remote systems, set
the property:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNumber</code>
</p>
<p>For more information on setting system properties for JMX, please
see <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html">Monitoring
and Management using JMX</a>.
