<h2>Java Application Project Configuration</h2>
Management actions are applied
to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Java Application</span> Project
type only. <br>
<br>
Configuration steps :<br>
<ol>
  <li>You must set a <span style="font-style: italic;">Java
Application</span> project as your main projet. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Correctly set your Runnable Class in the project properties. This can be done
automatically
when generating a JMX Agent.</li>
  <li>Check existing management related VM Options (if any). Be sure to
remove these options from the project properties menu. They can conflict
with these actions.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FAT File System issue. </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Run Main Project with JConsole</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Debug Main Project with JConsole</span>
actions do not work on FAT (see JConsole FAQ for more details on
the issue<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/faq.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/faq.html</a>)<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <span style="font-style: italic;">Run &gt; Remote
Management &gt; Run Main Project with Remote Management</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Debug Main Project with Remote Management
actions </span>instead<br>
    </li>
    <li>Or, to work around this issue, add<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">-XX:+PerfBypassFileSystemCheck</span> to
the project's VM Options (in the project's <span style="font-style: italic;">Properties
&gt; Run &gt; VM Options</span> textfield)<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">. DO NOT use this option in a real
environment</span>. It is an unsupported option that works around the
problem BUT that makes the management access unsecure.<br>
