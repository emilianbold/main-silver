<h2>Implementing the javax.management.MBeanRegistration
Interface<br>
</h2>
<br>
MBean registration is performed using a contextual action (enabled only if an <span style="font-weight: bold;">
MBean</span> is selected) located under the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Management</span> menu.
You can access the management menu from :<br>
<ul>
  <li>The contextual menu of the project tree node (right click on selected node)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Applicability of Actions</h2>
<br>
This action&nbsp; applies to any MBean type. If an MBean already
implements this interface, the action is disabled.<br>
This action applies to any MBean. You don't need to have generated them 
using the MBean wizard. <br>
MBeans imported from other contexts can be updated.<br>
<br>
<h2>Using the Implement MBeanRegistration Interface Action<br>
</h2>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>From the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">JMX</span>
menu, select <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Implement
MBeanRegistration Interface...</span></li>
  <li>A window is displayed with a message listing the set of methods
that will be added to the current MBean</li>
  <ul>
    <li>preRegister : Called before the MBean is registered in the
MBeanServer<br>
    </li>
    <li>postRegister : Called after the MBean is registered in the
MBeanServer</li>
    <li>preDeregister : Called before the MBean is unregistered in the
MBeanServer</li>
    <li>postDeregister : Called after the MBean is unregistered in the
MBeanServer</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You can generate private fields to keep references to the preRegister method parameters. These parameters are :</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The MBean ObjectName. If you are interested in the name the
MBean is given, you should keep a reference to this parameter.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The MBeanServer in which the MBean is registered. If you want
your MBean to make JMX call to other MBeans, you should keep this
reference.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click OK when you have finished </li>
  <li>MBeanRegistration methods are added at the end of the MBean class.</li>
  <li>The updated MBean class file is automatically opened in the editor.</li>
