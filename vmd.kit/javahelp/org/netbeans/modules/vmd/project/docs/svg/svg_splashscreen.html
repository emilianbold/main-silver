<h2>Adding SVG Splash Screens</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>Splash screens are used to enhance the look and feel of an application. Typically, 
  you use a splash screen when the program starts, or to display a logo or branding 
  information. Within Java ME, CLDC/MIDP applications, you can use SVG files to 
  provide static or animated splash screens. 
<p>To add a splash screen that uses an SVG file to your application: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag an SVGSplashScreen component from the Component Palette and drop it 
    in the Flow Designer.</li>
  <li>Drag an SVG file from the Navigator Window and drop it on the component. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Like conventional splash screens in the Visual Designer, you connect the splash 
  screen to the application flow by connecting the Mobile Device &quot;Start Point&quot; 
  port to the svgSplashScreen and connecting the &quot;Dismiss&quot; svgSplashScreen 
  port to the component shown when the splash screen is dismissed. If your splash 
  screen contains an animation, you can use the Properties window to adjust the 
  animation's behavior, such as setting when the splash screen will timeout, or 
  if the timeout can be interrupted.</p>
