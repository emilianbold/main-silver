<h2>Adding a Custom Component to the Visual Mobile Designer</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>You can use the Add Component wizard to add user-defined screens, and other
  Java components you have created outside the IDE, to the Visual Mobile Designer
  (VMD). Although they cannot be edited, you can still add them to the Flow Designer
  and incorporate them into your application. </p>
<p><strong>To add a custom component to the VMD:</strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the class you want to use is in your project's classpath.</li>
  <li>Right-click in the <a href="../ui/mvd_componentpallette.html">Component 
    Palette </a>and choose Palette Manager. <br>
    The <a href="../ui/mvd_componentpallettemanager.html">Palette Manager</a> 
    opens.</li>
  <li>Click the Add From Project button. </li>
  <li>Select the project that contains the object you want to add to the Component 
    Palette. Click next.</li>
  <li>Select any objects you want to add from the list of Found MIDP Classes. 
    <br>
    All classes inheriting from Displayable or Item on the selected project's 
    classpath are shown in the list. </li>
  <li>Optionally, check the Show Components from Libraries option to add class 
    components from the libraries and resources of the project. <br>
    <ul class="note">
      <li>Some components listed might be used by the emulator for internal processes, 
        and therefore can not be added to your application. </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Choose a category from the Add to Category dropdown menu. <br>
    The wizard will add the components to the selected category in the Component 
    Palette. </li>
  <li>Click Close to add the components.</li>
</ol>
