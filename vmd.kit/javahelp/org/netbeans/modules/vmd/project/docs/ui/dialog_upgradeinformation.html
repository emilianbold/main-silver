<h2>Upgrading CLDC/MIDP Projects from Version 5.0 to 6.0 </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>This dialog appears when you open the NetBeans 6.0 IDE with NetBeans Mobility 
  pack 6.0 and import MIDP/CLDC projects created using versions 5.0 or earlier of 
  the Mobility Pack.</p>
<p>Because of the following changes, projects imported and saved into the NetBeans 
  5.5 or 6.0 IDE cannot be re-opened in previous versions of the IDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in how pre- and post-init user code is written.</li>
  <li>Implementation of multi-guarded blocks into which you can write code directly.</li>
  <li>Changes in the WaitScreen and SplashScreen Java ME implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the
