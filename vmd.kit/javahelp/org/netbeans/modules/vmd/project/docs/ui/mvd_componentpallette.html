<h2>Visual Mobile Designer Component Palette</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) Component Palette contains groupings of all valid MIDP LCDUI components 
  that can be added using the VMD. </p>
<p>The Component Palette is available when you are using the VMD to design the 
  flow and user interface for your Mobile application. The Component Palette is 
  located by default in the upper right corner of the Visual Mobile Designer. 
</p>
<p>To add a component
    to your application, select it and drag it into the Flow Editor or Screen
  Designer. You can then edit the properties of the component within the <a href="mvd_flowdesigner.html">Flow
  Designer</a> or <a href="mvd_screendesigner.html">Screen Designer</a>, or in the properties window.</p>
<p>You can customize the organization of the Component Palette or add custom components 
  to the palette by right-clicking the Component Palette and choosing Palette 
  Manager. This opens the <a href="mvd_componentpallettemanager.html">Component 
  Palette Manager</a>. </p>
<p>By default, the Component Palette organizes components into the following
  categories: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Displayables. </strong>Components that provide the basic visual 
    display, such as alerts, forms, lists, and text boxes. <strong> </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Commands.</strong> Components for each command type defined 
    by <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.Command</code>. </li>
  <li><strong>Elements.</strong> Lists elements that 
    can be added to the <code>List</code> and <code>ChoiceGroup</code> items.</li>
  <li><strong>Items.</strong> Components that perform a function within 
    an item, such as a date field, or change the appearance of an item, 
    such as placeholder components for images and text fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Flow.</strong> Components that allow you to connect separate VMD projects into an integrated application.</li>
  <li><strong>Resources.</strong> Resources that can be used by other objects including fonts, images, and a ticker.</li>
  <li><strong>SVG Components.</strong> Components that allow you to integrate SVG files into your project using features like Wait Screen and  Menu. </li>
  <li><strong>Custom.</strong> Lists custom components you create for use in the Visual Mobile Designer.</li>
</ul>
