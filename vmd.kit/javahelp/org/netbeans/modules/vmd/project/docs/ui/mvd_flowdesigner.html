<h2>Visual Mobile Designer: Flow Designer</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You use the Flow Designer window of the Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) to 
  map out the flow of the application by adding screens and other UI components,
and associating commands with these components.</p>
<p>The Flow Designer window opens when you double-click on the node of a Visual 
  MIDlet (<img src="../images/icon-visualmidlet.gif" width="23" height="22">) 
  in the Projects window. All designs contain a Mobile Device element that serves 
  as the starting point for the MIDlet. </p>
<p>The first step to designing the application flow is to drag Screens (Alerts,
  Forms, Lists, or TextBoxes) from the Component Palette on to the Flow Designer
  view. After you add a Screen, you can drag the appropriate Commands, Form Items,
  Elements, Resources, and Custom Components to add them to the application flow.
  You can edit a Screen by double-clicking on it and opening the <a href="mvd_screendesigner.html">Screen
  Designer</a>  view. </p>
<p>Transition sources are displayed on the right side of the component to which 
  they are attached. You create transitions to different Screens by selecting 
  the Transition Source and dragging it to the target Screen. The connection is 
  shown in the Flow Designer as a line. </p>
<p>To edit a Transition Source, click
    on the line to edit its <a href="mvd_properties.html">properties</a>, or double-click on the line to open the
    <a href="mvd_actioneditor.html">Action Editor</a>. </p>
