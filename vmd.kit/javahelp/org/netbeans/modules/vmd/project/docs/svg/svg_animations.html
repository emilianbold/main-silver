<h2>Working with SVG Animations</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<div class="indent"> 
  <p>The <code>svgPlayer</code> component in the <a href="../mvd/mvd_about.html">Visual 
    Mobile Designer</a> lets you insert an animated SVG file anywhere in your 
    MIDP application flow or within a screen. The player is supported by the <code>SVGAnimator</code> class in the JSR-226 API. 
  <p>To add an animated SVG file into your application: </div>
<ol>
  <li>
    <div class="indent">Drag the svgPlayer component from the Component 
      Palette and drop it in the Flow Designer. </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="indent">Drag an SVG file from the Navigator window and drop it 
      on the component. </div>
  </li>
</ol>
  <p>
    To control how the animation behaves in the screen or 
      application flow, you can set the set the following properties: </div>
  </p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent"> <strong>Start Animation Immediately</strong>. Whether 
      the component should start animation immediately when it appears on the 
      display. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent"><strong>Animation Time Increment</strong>. The minimal 
      time, in seconds, that should elapse between frame rendering. This value 
      must be greater than zero. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent"><strong>Reset Animation When Stopped</strong> - If true, 
      the component automatically resets the animation to the its beginning when 
      the component is dismissed from the screen. If false, the animation is not 
      reset and next time the component is displayed, the animation automatically 
      continues where it was stopped. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent"><strong>Full Screen</strong> - Determines whether the 
      component is shown in a full screen. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
