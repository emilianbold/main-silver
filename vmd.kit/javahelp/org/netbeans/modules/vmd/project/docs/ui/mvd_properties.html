<h2>Visual Mobile Designer Properties View</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) Properties window displays the editable properties 
  for any object selected in the VMD. The properties window is located by default 
  at the bottom right corner of the Visual Mobile Designer. </p>
<p>The property sheet contains all properties for the selected object. The types
  of properties shown depend upon the category and type of object selected. </p>
<p><strong> Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Properties. </strong> What occurs when a specific command is 
    selected on a screen or object.</li>
  <li><strong>Instance Name.</strong> The name of the object.</li>
  <li><strong>Lazy Initialized.</strong> Lazy Initialized. If checked, the component 
  is initialized the first time the component is needed. <br>
  If it is not checked, the component is initialized when the MIDlet's <code>startApp()</code> 
  method is invoked.
    <br>
    Note that if you change your initial setting, the VMD will not change source 
    code outside of guarded blocks. You must therefore go to the
    source code and edit the code manually:
	
<ul>
  <li> If you uncheck Lazy Initialized, replace the <code>getMyComponent ()</code> 
    method (that acquires an instance of the component) with a <code>myComponent</code> 
    field where the instance is stored.</li>
  <li></li>
  If you check Lazy Initialized, replace the <code>myComponent</code> field with 
  a <code>getMyComponent()</code> method. </p> 


  <p>For example, if you have the code</p>
  <p><code>getSmsSender().sendSMS(getPhoneNumberTextField().getString(),
    getMessageTextBox().getString());</code></p>
  <p>and set &quot;Lazy Initialized&quot; from True to False on the <code>smsSender</code> 
    component,<br>
    you must edit the code to:</p>
  <p><code>smsSender.sendSMS(getPhoneNumberTextField().getString(),
    getMessageTextBox().getString());</code></p>
	</ul>
  <p>Several property types have special editors associated with them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="mvd_stringeditor.html">String Editor</a></strong>. Enables 
      you to edit strings of plain text, or choose to have the value used as custom 
      Java code. </li>
    <li><a href="mvd_actioneditor.html"><strong>Action Editor.</strong></a> Enables 
      you to edit details of the Action properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraint Editor.</strong> The radio buttons specify the restrictive 
      constraint settings. Checkboxes specify any additional constraint modifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Layout Editor.</strong> Enables you to control various aspects 
      of image appearance, including alignment and image size.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
