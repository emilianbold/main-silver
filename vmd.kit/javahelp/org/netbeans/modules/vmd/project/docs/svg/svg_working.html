<h2>Working with SVG Files</h2>

<p>The Visual Mobile Designer enables you to incorporate Scalable Vector Graphic 
  images and animations into your Java ME, CLDC/MIDP applications. The Component 
  Palette contains a section of SVG components that you can drag and drop into 
  your application flow and screen designs. </p>

        <li>Drag and drop an SVG graphic from the Projects window into the component. 
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Alternately, you can double-click a component to open it in the 
            Screen Designer, then drag an SVG file into the open screen. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With either approach, an SVG Image is added to the Resources folder 
          in the Navigator Window.</p>
        <li>Drag command lines from the ports of the SVG components to other components 
          in the application flow. </li>
