<h2>Adding an SVG Wait Screen</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>Wait Screens allow users to execute a blocking background task (for example, 
  connecting to a network), and show the progress of the task or display a message 
  on the screen to inform the user that the application is still working as intended. 
  Within Java ME, CLDC/MIDP applications, you can use SVG files to provide static 
  or animated wait screens. 
<p>To add an SVG wait screen: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag an svgWaitScreen component from the Component Palette and drop it in 
    the Flow Designer. </li>
  <li>Drag an SVG file from the Explorer Window and drop it on the created component.</li>
</ol>  
<p> The svgWaitScreen component contains two ports, &quot;Success&quot; and 
    &quot;Failure&quot;. When the background task is successfully finished (that 
    is, no exception is thrown), the component automatically continues with the 
    next action in the application flow. If the task fails (an exception is thrown), 
    the component automatically continues with the action connected to the &quot;Failure&quot; 
    port.</p>
