<h2>About Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Files</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a WC3 standard defined in JSR-226 that uses 
  XML code to display two-dimensional images, animation and text within Java ME, 
  CLDC/MIDP applications. It's compact size and consistent appearance across different 
  platforms and screen resolutions makes it an attractive graphics format for 
  mobile developers. Device support for SVG is growing, but still varies depending 
  on the mobile device and is not as widely supported as PNG. SVG Tiny 1.1  is 
  supported in this release. SVG-T 1.2 and 1.0 are supported, but may not work properly in all situations. 
<p>The advantages SVG has over PNG and other image file types include: 
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Scalability.</strong> SVG allows optimal quality on displays with 
    different pixel resolutions, color depth, CPU power, and memory. It also allows 
    image zooming without loss of quality.</li>
  <li><strong> Size.</strong> SVG and SVGZ (SVG zipped) files can be several times 
    smaller than PNG files of similar quality, enabling developers to create graphically 
    rich applications for platforms with limited hardware resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Animation</strong>. SVG enables scripting and animation that allows 
    users to interact with visual content.</li>
  <li><strong>Searchability.</strong> Because SVG is made of XML code, users can 
    search for text embedded in the image file. For example, you can find the 
    name of a street or town on a map image. </li>
</ul>
