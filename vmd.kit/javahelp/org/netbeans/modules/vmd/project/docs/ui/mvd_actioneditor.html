<h2>Visual Mobile Designer Action Editor</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) Action Editor enables you to edit the properties
  associated with commands.</p>
<p>You open the Action Editor by double-clicking on a transition in the Flow Designer, 
  or by clicking on the Ellipsis (...) button of the Action properties of a command. 
</p>
<p>In the Action Editor, you can edit three areas of action properties:</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
<p>What should be done when this action is performed. Six options are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Switch to Displayable.</strong> When the action is performed, the 
    flow switches to a new screen chosen from the drop-down menu. </li>
  <li><strong>Call.</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>List Action.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Go to Previous Displayable.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Exit MIDlet.</strong> When the action is performed, the application 
    is closed.</li>
  <li><strong>Do Nothing.</strong> No switching occurs. </li>
</ul>
