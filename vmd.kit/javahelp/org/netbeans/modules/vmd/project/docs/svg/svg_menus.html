<h2>Adding SVG Menus</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<div class="indent"> 
  <p>The possibilities for graphical and animated menus are virtually unlimited 
    when you use SVG graphics for the background and individual menu items. In 
    the Visual Mobile Designer, you can add a menu you've already created to the 
    application flow, or add a menu background and then add separate menu items 
    to the menu.</p>
  <p>To add a menu item: </p>
</div>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent">Drag a menu component from the palette and drop it in 
      the Flow Designer window. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent">Assign an SVG image to the component by dragging and dropping 
      an SVG graphic from the Explorer window. </div>
  </li>
  <li> You can create menu items within the menu in two ways: </li>

<ul>
  <li>If the image you drop contains elements (representing menu items) with IDs 
    that start with the &quot;<code>menuItem_</code>&quot; string, the elements 
    are automatically recognized by the IDE and are added to the component as 
    menu items, sorted alphabetically. </li>
  <li>If the SVG image does not contain elements with IDs that start with the 
    &quot;<code>menuitem_</code>&quot; string, you can add names of the elements 
    representing individual menu items by dragging SVGMenu Element components 
    from the Component Palette and dropping them on the SVGMenu component. The 
    SVGMenu Element component is then added to the SVGMenu and in the Flow Designer 
    you can see a new port available named &quot;menuItem_&quot;. You can then 
    rename the port to correspond to the element ID from the SVG file. </li>
</ul>

  <p>In the Flow Designer window, you 'll see that the svgMenu component now 
    contains several ports named <code>menuItem_</code>. These ports correspond 
    to the individual menu elements and can be used for flow design as any other 
    ports. The menu elements are also visible in the Navigator Window and can 
    be deleted or reordered in that window as well. </p>
  <li>To add the menu to a project flow, drag a line from each <code>_menuitem</code> 
    port to a component or other SVG animation in the application flow. </li>
</ol>
