<h2>VMD Add From Project Wizard: Select Classes</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the Add From Project wizard to add user-defined screens, and other 
  Java components you have created outside the IDE, to the Visual Mobile Designer 
  (VMD). Although they cannot be edited in the IDE, you can still add custom components 
  to the Flow Designer and incorporate them into your application. </p>
<p>To open the Select Classes page, right-click in the Component Palette and choose 
  Palette Manager. In the Palette Manager, click the Add From Project button. 
  In the Select Project page, click Next. </p>
<p>In the Select Classes page, choose the project that contains the class or classes 
  you want to add. All MIDP classes that extend <code>Displayable</code> or <code>Items</code> 
  and have not already been added to the Palette are shown in the Found MIDP Classes 
  box. </p>
<p>This screen also provides the following checkbox:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Show Component from Libraries.</strong> If checked,  the wizard also shows class components
    from project's libraries and
    resources.</li>
<ul class="note">
    <li>Some library components displayed might be internal
      components used by the emulator, but not available for use in the VMD. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Use the Add into Category dropdown menu to choose the category into which
  the selected components are added. </p>
