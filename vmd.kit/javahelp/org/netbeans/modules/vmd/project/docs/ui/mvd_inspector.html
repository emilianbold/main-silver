<h2>Visual Mobile Designer Navigator View</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) Navigator view displays all of the objects
  that have been added to the application with the Visual Designer. </p>
<p>The Navigator view is available when you are using the VMD to design the flow 
  and user interface for your Mobile application. The default location of the 
  Navigator is the lower left corner of the Visual Mobile Designer. </p>
<p>The Navigator displays all of the objects in the form of a menu tree. You
  can use the menu tree to add, remove, or change the order of objects in the
  menu. Objects selected  in the Navigator are highlighted in Screen
  Designer view, if the containing component is currently opened in the screen
  designer
  view.
The objects properties are displayed
  in the Property Sheet window.</p>
<p>You can also edit the <a href="mvd_properties.html">properties</a> of any object in the menu by right-clicking
  on the node. The specific actions you can perform on a node in the Navigator
  window depend upon
  the category
  and type of the object. </p>
<p>The Visual Design
  root node has properties that define: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MIDP version. </strong>Displays the <object
classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
   <param name="content"
value="../glossary/gloss_midp.html"> 
   <param name="viewerActivator"
value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
   <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
   <param name="viewerSize" value="400,160">
   <param name="text" value="MIDP">
   <param name="textFontFamily" value="SansSerif">
   <param name="textFontSize" value="small">
   <param name="textFontWeight" value="bold">
   <param name="textFontStyle" value="italic">
   <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
 version used for the Visual
    Design.<br>
    You can change the MIDP version used by the project by right-clicking on
    the node and choosing Convert To. 
    <ul class="note">
        
      <li>If you convert from MIDP 2.0 to MIDP 1.0, components and settings that 
        are not compatible with MIDP 1.0 are deleted from the design. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Generate Threaded Command Listeners.</strong> If checked, the IDE 
    generates command listeners on multiple threads. This prevents the UI from 
    freezing up when one thread is handling everything, such as command listening 
    and a time consuming or blocking operation, such a network communication. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Start Point Action.</strong> The action that is used when the
    MIDlet is started. For example, when the MIDlet is selected, a menu screen
    displays. Clicking on the elipsis (...) button opens the <a href="mvd_actioneditor.html">Action
    Editor</a>. </li>
