DN_org.netbeans.modules.java.hints.jdk.ThrowableInitCause=Unnecessary Throwable.initCause
DESC_org.netbeans.modules.java.hints.jdk.ThrowableInitCause=Finds invocations of Throwable.initCause which can be replaced with simple constructor invocation. \
When the "Never alter result of getMessage()" checkbox is unchecked, <code>(IllegalStateException) new IllegalStateException().initCause(ex)</code> will be \
rewritten to <code>new IllegalStateException(ex)</code>, which will alter the value of getMessage(). When the checkbox is checked, the \
code will become <code>new IllegalStateException(null, ex)</code>. Similar rule holds for creating the exception from <code>getMessage()</code> \
or <code>getLocalizedMessage()</code> of the cause.
FIX_ThrowableInitCause=Use exception constructor
ERR_ThrowableInitCause=Unnecessary use of Throwable.initCause
DN_ThrowableInitCauseStrict=Always keep result of getMessage()
TP_ThrowableInitCauseStrict=Always keep result of getMessage()
