        <h2>Whitelisting in Oracle Cloud</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>Oracle Cloud does not support some standard Java API methods, such as <tt>System.exit()</tt>. 
        The Oracle Cloud <em>whitelist</em> defines all methods that are allowed. 
        During deployment of an application to Oracle Cloud the Cloud server tests whitelist compliance. 
        If the whitelist is violated the Cloud server refuses to deploy the application.</p>
        <p>NetBeans IDE helps prevent whitelist-related errors by notifying you of whitelist violations while you code. 
        Code completion is limited by whitelisting, and whitelist violations are highlighted in the code. 
        When you run the Verify action on a web application deployed to Oracle Cloud Remote server
        the Output window displays the whitelisting violations. 
        To run the Verify action, right-click the application's root node in the Projects window and select Verify.</p>

        <p>For more details about working with Oracle Cloud in the IDE, see the following document.</p>
