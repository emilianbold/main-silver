        <h2>Issue Tracking: Create Issue Tracker Dialog Box: Bugzilla</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The Create Issue Tracker dialog box enables you to specify the connection
        details for an issue tracker.
        After you create a tracker, a node for the tracker appears under the
        Issue Tracker node in the Services window and you can view, submit and resolve issues
        in the IDE.
        </p>

        <p>You see this dialog box when you right-click the Issue Trackers node in the
        Services window and choose Create Issue Tracker and select Bugzilla in the Connector dropdown list.
        You might also see this dialog if you right-click a registered Bugzilla
        issue tracker node in the Services window and choose Edit in the popup menu.</p>

        <p>To register a Bugzilla issue tracker, specify the following properties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Connector.</strong> Select Bugzilla from the dropdown list.</li>
        <li><strong>Name.</strong> The name of the tracker as it will be displayed in the IDE under the
            Issue Tracking node in the Services window.
            The name will also be listed in the drop down menu when you open the Find Issues tab from
            the Services window.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Tracker URL.</strong> Specify the URL for the tracker.</li>
        <li><strong>Username.</strong> Specify the username that is registered with the issue tracker.</li>
        <li><strong>Password.</strong> Specify the username that is registered with the issue tracker.</li>
        <li><strong>Use HTTP Authentication.</strong> Select if the issue tracker requires authentication.
            If selected, you need to specify the username and password.
            Click Validate to connect to the tracker and check that the authentication details are correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Local Usernames.</strong> When selected,
            the IDE uses the user name (e.g., without <tt>@mydomain.com</tt>) instead of an email address when submitting issues.
            <p>When authorizing and identifying users, some issue trackers are configured to use a registered user name as the user id
            and some are configured to use an email address.
            Select this option when the issue tracker is configured to use a user name.</p>
            </li>
    </ul>
