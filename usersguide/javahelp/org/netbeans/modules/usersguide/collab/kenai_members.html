        <h2>Chatting with Project Members</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>A Kenai project can have multiple members collaborating on a project.
        If the chat room for a Kenai project is enabled, you can exchange messages in the project's chat room
        from within the IDE.
        You can also engage in private chats with members of projects.</p>

        <p>To chat with project members you must be logged in to Kenai and logged in to the chat server.
        You can log in to Chat when you log in to Kenai.
        If you do not log in to Chat when you log in to Kenai, you can enable Chat
        after you login to Kenai by clicking the Offline icon in the status bar.
        For more about enabling and disabling Chat, see <a href="kenai_chat-login.html">Logging in to Chat</a>.</p>


        <h3>Project Chat Rooms and Private Chats</h3>
        <p>You can use the Chat window for a project to exchange messages with other project members.
        Each Kenai project can have an associated chat room open to members of the project.
        You can also have private chats with individual project members from within the IDE.</p>

        <p>To enter a chat room or initiate a private chat, perform the following steps.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Chat from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Click the New Chat button (&nbsp;<img src="../images/chatwindows.png">&nbsp;).
                <p>The window displays a list of project chat rooms and project members that are online and available for chat.</p></li>
            <li>Double-click the name of the project to enter the project chat room, or
                the name of the member to start a private chat.
                <p>You can use the drop-down list to filter the list of online members according to project.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
