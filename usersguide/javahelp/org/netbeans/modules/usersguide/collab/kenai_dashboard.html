        <h2>Using the Team Dashboard</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>The Team Dashboard enables you to quickly view information
        about Team projects that you have joined or opened.
        If you are logged in to a Team Server, the projects that you
        have joined are automatically listed in the Team Dashboard.
        </p>

        <p><strong>To open the Team Dashboard:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Team Dashboard from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
        You can join projects that you are interested in by bookmarking the project on the Team Server site.
        When you log in to a Team Server in the IDE, all the projects that you bookmarked are listed under My Projects in the Team Dashboard.
        My Projects provides an overview that enables you to monitor and
        access each project's issues (&nbsp;<img src="../images/kenai-bug.png">&nbsp;) and messages (&nbsp;<img src="../images/chat-newmessage.png">&nbsp;).
        To view more details about a specific project, click the Open Project icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/kenai-dash-open.png">&nbsp;)
        to add the project to the list under Open Projects.
        </p>


        <h3>Open Projects</h3>
        <p>
        You can view additional details about a Team project by opening the project in the Team Dashboard.
        When you open a project, a node for the project is displayed under Open Projects.
        If you joined the project by bookmarking the project, the name is displayed in bold.
        Opening a project in the Team Dashboard does not automatically bookmark the project.
        </p>
        <p>You can open a project in the following ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking the Open Project icon of a project under My Projects in the Team Dashboard</li>
            <li>Opening a project using the Open Team Project dialog box.
