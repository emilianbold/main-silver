        <h2>Importing Settings from a Previous Version of the IDE</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When you launch a new version of the IDE for the first time, you are
        prompted with the option of importing settings from a previous version of
        the IDE. This prompt occurs only if you have a user directory on your 
        system from the previous version of the IDE and the user directory is in 
        the default location.</p>

        <p>The settings that are imported include the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
            <li>Most Source Editor font and color settings</li>
            <li>Java Platform Manager contents</li>
            <li>Library Manager contents</li>
            <li>Database drivers</li>
            <li>Servers</li>            
        </ul>

        <p>You can recreate the conditions of the first launch at any time by deleting your current userdir.
        When you restart the IDE you will be prompted with the option of importing settings from a previous version of
        the IDE.</p>

        <p>For more details about locating your current userdir, see the following FAQ.</p>

            <param name="content" value="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir">
            <param name="text" value="<html><u>FaqWhatIsUserdir</u></html>">

        </object>
        </p>

        <ul class="warning">
            <li>If you delete your userdir you could lose other important
            settings. In addition, you might also lose any modules you have installed
            through the Update Center in the new version and you may need to reinstall or reactivate those modules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Importing Settings After the First Start of the IDE</h3>
        
        <p>If you do not import the settings at the first launch but later decide that 
        you would like to import the settings from a previous installation,
        you can choose the settings that you would like to import in the Options window.
