<h2>Local History View for Non-Supported File Formats</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Local History View allows to quickly access the local history of changes of the relevant file. You can generally open the Local History View by 
choosing Team &gt; Local history &gt; Show Local history from the main menu. If a file is open in the Source Editor, you can right-click the tab and choose Local history &gt; Show Local history from the popup menu to open the file in a separate History View tab.</p>

<p>This topic introduces the following Local History View features:</p>
<dl>
  <dd><a href="#tabs">Tabs</a></dd>
  
  <dd><a href="#diff">Diff Viewer</a></dd>
  
</dl>
<h3><a name="tabs">Tabs</a></h3>
<p>The top of the Local History View tab shows the filename  followed by [LocalHistory].</p>
<p>If multiple files are open, you can split the History View by clicking and dragging the tab. As you drag to different parts of the editing area, you see a red outline that shows you where the new window will open. When one of these boxes appears, you can drop the document and split the pane.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>You must close the split file if you want the editor to return to its unsplit
    state. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can right-click a tab to access the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Close.</b> Closes the selected file.</li>
  <li><b>Close All.</b> Closes all files that are open in the History 
Editor area.</li>
<li><b>Close Other. </b> Closes all files except for the selected file.</li>


<li><b>Maximize/Restore. Hides</b> other windows and 
expands the History Editor to use all of the window space in the IDE. To 
return the windows to the state that they were before you chose Maximize, deselect the checked Maximize option. 
You can also maximize and restore the History Editor by double-clicking a tab.</li>
<li><b>Float/Dock.</b> Opens document in an editor in a new window. If window is already floating, the Dock option appears instead.</li>
<li><b>Clone Document.</b> Opens a new tab for the same document. This command is 
particularly useful in combination with splitting the window so that you can view 
different parts of the same file simultaneously.</li>
<li><b>New Document Tab Group/Collapse Document Tab Group.</b> Splits the editor  vertically into parts containing open documents in new windows.</li>
<li><b>Editors.</b> Allows for switching between the Source and History editors.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="diff">Diff Viewer</a></h3>
<p>The Diff Viewer is divided into two panes: </p>
<ul>
<li><a name="upper"></a><b>Upper pane.</b> Contains a table that enables you to view a summary of a file's evolution by the date and time stamps. A stamp is applied whenever a file is saved in the IDE. <br> 
  The table features the following two columns:
  <ul>
   <li><b>Version.</b> The versions are listed according to date, with the most current version displayed on top. They can be sorted by clicking the Version column header.</li>
   <li><b>Label.</b> Lists any label associated with the file. The labels can be sorted by clicking the Labels column header.</li>
  </ul>

      <ul class="note">
            <li>To add a label to a specific file version, click on the version row beneath the Label column and type in a label directly.</li>

            <li>You can call commands from the table directly on versions using the right-click menu:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Revert from History</b>. Reverts your current file to the selected version.</li>
                    <li><b>Delete from History</b>. Deletes the selected version from the Local History repository.</li>
					<li><b>Show only rows where</b>.  Filters versions in accordance with the filter specified (Label ==, Label &lt;&gt;, Label &gt;, Label &lt;, Label &gt;=, Label &lt;=, No Filter). Applicable to labels only.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="lower"></a><b>Lower pane.</b> Enables you to compare revisions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences between the files being compared.</li> 
</ul>
<p>You can navigate among individual differences between file versions using the 
                following buttons in the toolbar on the lower pane:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <td align="right"><strong>Previous</strong> (<img src="../images/diff-prev.png" 
                        alt="previous difference button">)</td>  
				<td>Highlights the previous difference found between versions.</td>  
			</tr> 
			<tr>
                <td align="right"><strong>Next</strong> (<img src="../images/diff-next.png" 
                        alt="next difference button">)  </td>  
				<td>Highlights the next difference found between versions.</td>  
			</tr>   
</table>         
                


<p>The Diff Viewer provides the following UI components:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <td align="right"><strong>Blue</strong> 
                    ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                <td>Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="right"><strong>Green</strong> 
                    ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                <td>Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="right"><strong>Red</strong> 
                    ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                <td>Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision.</td>                
            </tr>
        </table>
        
                
        <p>The following icons allow you to make changes directly to the file:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Replace</strong> 
                    ( <img src="../images/insert.png" alt="insert icon"> )</td>
                <td>Inserts the highlighted text from the previous revision into the current revision.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Move All</strong> 
                    ( <img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="arrow icon"> )</td>
                <td>Reverts the file's current version to the state of the selected previous version.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Remove</strong>&nbsp;
                    ( <img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon"> )</td>
                <td>Removes the highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the previous version.</td>                
            </tr>
        </table>
