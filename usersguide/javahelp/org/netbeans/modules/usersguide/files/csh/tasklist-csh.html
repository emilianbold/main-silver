    <p>The Action Items window toolbar is displayed on the left side of the window and has the following buttons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current File.</b> When selected, the IDE scans the file that is 
        currently selected in the editor and displays a list of the action items found 
        in that file. When you open a new file in the editor, the file is scanned 
        and only the action items in that file are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Selected projects.</b> When selected, the 
        IDE scans all the files in the currently selected project and displays all 
        the action items in the project in the window. </li>

        open projects and displays a list of all the action items in the window. </li>

        <li><b>Group Action Items By Category.</b> When selected, the list of action items is 
        grouped by category.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Issues Marked as Action Items</h3>
    <p>The IDE provides support for some issue trackers that enables you to work with issues from within the IDE.
    If you are using a supported issue tracker, you can add an issue to your personal list
    of action items by clicking Add to Action Items in the tab for the issue.
    You can click an issue entry in the Action Items window to open the issue tab in the main window.
    You can right-click the issue entry to open a popup menu that enables you to remove the issue from the list.</p>
