        <p>The Select The Diff Patch dialog box enables you to apply patches to code.</p>
        
        <p>You access this dialog box by selecting a file or folder in the Projects or Files
        window and either:</p> 
		<ul> 
		<li>choosing Tools &gt; Apply Diff Patch from the main menu.</li>
	    <li>right-clicking a file or folder  and choosing Tools &gt; Apply Diff Patch.</li>
		</ul>
        
        <p>In the Select The Diff Patch  dialog box, you have to browse to and select the patch file you want to apply.</p>
		<p>When you click Patch, the IDE applies the changes contained in the selected patch to the chosen  file or folder and informs you that patch is successfully applied.<br> 
		  In the Question dialog box, click Yes to view applied changes in the Diff Viewer or No to close the dialog box. </p>
