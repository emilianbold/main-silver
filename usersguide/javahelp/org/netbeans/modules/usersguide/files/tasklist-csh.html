    <h2>Task List Window</h2>
    <p>The Task List window displays a unified list of things that you need to 
    resolve in your various files.
    The Task List window also displays a list of the issues that you added as a personal task.</p>


    <h3>Tasks in Files</h3>
    <p>Task List window entries are created by some types of errors and by 
    the occurrence of specific character patterns in the file.
    You can click an entry in the Task List window to jump to the line of the file where
    the task needs to be resolved.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the things that create task list entries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code comments that contain the patterns <tt>TODO</tt>, <tt>XXX</tt>, or <tt>FIXME</tt></li>
        <li>The pattern <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt>, which denotes merge conflicts in CVS and other 
        version control systems</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) Javadoc comments that contain the <tt>@todo</tt> keyword</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) lines where compiler errors are registered</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Issues Marked as Tasks</h3>
    <p>The IDE provides support for some issue trackers that enables you to work with issues from within the IDE.
    If you are using a supported issue tracker, you can add an issue to your personal task list
    by clicking Add to Tasklist in the tab for the issue.
    You can click an issue entry in the Task List window to open the issue tab in the main window.
    You can right-click the issue entry to open a popup menu that enables you to remove the issue from the
    list.</p>

    <p>For details about adding an issue to your task list, see <a href="../collab/issues_working.html">Working With Issues</a>.</p>

    <p>You can do the following in the Task List window:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jump to a To Do task or issue.</li>
        <li>Sort and filter the entries displayed in the window.</li>
        <li>Create and modify Task List filters.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To open the Task List window, choose Window &gt; Task List (Ctrl-6) from the main menu.
    The Task List displays found TODO tasks and issues.
    You can sort the list by clicking the column heading of the Task List.
    The Task List toolbar enables you to modify and work with the displayed tasks.</p>



    
    <h3>Task List Window Toolbar</h3>
    <p>The Task List window toolbar has the following buttons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current File.</b> When selected, the IDE scans the file that is 
        currently selected in the Source Editor and displays the To Do tasks found 
        in that file. When you open a new file in the editor, the file is scanned 
        and only the To Do tasks in that file are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Main project and dependent projects.</b> When selected, the 
        IDE scans all files open in the Source Editor and displays all 
        tasks in the open files. When you open a file in the editor, the file is 
        scanned and the tasks in that file are added to the list of displayed tasks.</li>
        <li><b>All opened projects.</b> </li>
        <li><b>Filter.</b> You can click the drop-down list on this button to set 
        a filter on the items to be displayed. You can also create and modify filters.</li>
        <li><b>Group Tasks By Category.</b></li>
    </ul>
