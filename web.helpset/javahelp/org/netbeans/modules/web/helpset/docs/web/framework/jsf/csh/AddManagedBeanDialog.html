        <h2>Add Managed Bean Dialog Box</h2>

        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>A JSF managed bean, or &quot;backing bean&quot; is a Java class that adheres to
            JavaBean conventions, and is associated with UI components used in a page. A managed
            bean defines UI component properties, each of which is bound to either a component's
            value or a component instance. A managed bean can also define methods that perform
            functions associated with a component, including validation, event handling, and
            navigation processing.</p>

        <p>You arrive at this dialog box by right-clicking in a Faces configuration file
            (<code>faces-config.xml</code>) and choosing Insert &gt; Managed Bean. The purpose
            of the dialog is to register an existing JSF managed bean with the application
            by adding an entry to the Faces configuration file.</p>

        <p class="note">JSF 2.0 applications do not require the <code>faces-config.xml</code>
            file. You can equally declare a managed bean using the <code>@ManagedBean</code>
            annotation directly within the managed bean class.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bean Name:</strong> Specifies the name which the managed bean can be
                invoked by.</li>

            <li><strong>Bean Class:</strong> Specifies the fully qualified class name of the
                Java class that will be used to instantiate a new instance, if creation of the
                specified managed bean is requested. The specified class must conform to standard
                JavaBean conventions. In particular, it must have a public, no-argument constructor,
                and properties must be accessible using <em>get</em> and <em>set</em>, following
                standard naming conventions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Specifies the scope into which a newly created instance of
                the specified managed bean will be stored (default is <code>request</code>; choose
                <code>none</code> if you want to refrain from placing bean instances in any scope).</li>

            <li><strong>Bean Description:</strong> An optional textual description of the element,
                which can be flagged with a language code using the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute.</li>
        </ul>
