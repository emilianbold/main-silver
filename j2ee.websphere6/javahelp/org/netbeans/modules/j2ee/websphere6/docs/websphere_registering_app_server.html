    <ul class="note">
        <li>Alternatively, right-click the Servers node in the Services window and choose Add Server from the popup menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Select the version of the IBM WebSphere Application Server that you want to register.</li>
        <li>In the Name field, type a name for the server instance. <br>
        This name is used to identify the server in the IDE.</li>
        <li>Click Next.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>In the Server Location pane, use the Browse button to navigate to and select the installation directory of your application server.
