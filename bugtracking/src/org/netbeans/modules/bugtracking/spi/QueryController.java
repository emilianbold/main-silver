/**
 * Provides access to a {@link Query}-s UI.

 * Typically a Query UI should provide at least a query criteria 
 * editor available when creating new queries or modifying existing ones. 
 * In case it isn't possible to create or modify a query on the client it is 
 * possible to provide no QueryController and no UI at all - e.g. an immutable 
 * server defined query with no remote api to modify the criteria.
 * <br/>
 * The results of an query (see {@link QueryProvider<Q>#getIssues(java.lang.Object)}  
 * are always presented in the TaskDashboard, but eventually, in case the need appears,
 * it is also possible for the bugtracking plugin implementation to provide a
 * customized result view - e.g a table listing more attributes than then TasksDashboard does.
