<h2>Configuring Security Mechanism Profiles for Sun Java System Access Manager Instances</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>For each security mechanism, the IDE includes a predefined profile for that mechanism. You can modify these predefined profiles to suit your implementation.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>The configuration changes you make in the <a href="../csh/csh_amserverinstance.html">Edit <i>security-mechanism</i> Profile dialog box</a> are applied in real-time to the server instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To configure a security mechanism profile for a Sun Java System Access Manager instance:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Services window, expand the the <tt>Sun Java System Access Managers</tt> node.</li>
<li>Expand the <i>server-instance</i> node for which you want to configure a security mechanism profile and then expand the <tt>Profiles</tt> node.<br>
A subnode appears for each security mechanism profile that you can configure.</li>
<li>Right-click the <tt><i>security-mechanism-profile</i></tt> node and choose Edit.<br>
The <a href="../csh/csh_amserverinstance.html">Edit <i>security-mechanism</i> Profile dialog box</a> opens.</li>
<li>Select the Sign Response checkbox.<br>
<ul class="note">
<li>If you clear this checkbox for the UserNameToken profile, the settings under Existing&nbsp;Certificate&nbsp;Settings are disabled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Under Existing&nbsp;Certificate&nbsp;Settings, to use a custom keystore, clear the Use Default Key Store checkbox and enter the required information in each of the following fields:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Keystore Location.</b> Specifies the location of the keystore file that contains the key alias. This should be specified as an absolute path.
<ul class="note">
<li>The Browse button for the Keystore Location field is only enabled for local Access Manager instances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Keystore Password.</b> Specifies the password needed to access the keystore file.</li>
<li><b>Key Alias.</b> Specifies the key alias for the entry in the keystore. Each entry in a keystore file is identified by an alias string.</li>
<li><b>Key Alias Password.</b> Specifies the password needed to access the key alias for the entry in the keystore.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>If you are using the Liberty security mechanism, you must perform the steps described in <a href="config_liberty_customkeystore.html">Using a Custom Keystore for the Liberty Token Profile</a> to prevent failure at runtime.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>For the UserNameToken profile, create an entry for each web service client by doing the following:
<ol type="a">
<li>Click Add.</li>
<li>In the Add User dialog box, type the user name and password for the web service client.<br>
The user name must be unique.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>At the Edit <i>security-mechanism-profile</i> Profile dialog box, click OK.</li>
</ol>
