<h2>Configuring Support for the Liberty SAML Token Profile</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>For the Liberty sample, NetBeans Enterprise Pack supports three token profiles: <tt>LibertyBearerToken</tt>, <tt>LibertyX509Token</tt>, and <tt>LibertySAMLToken</tt>. If you want to use the <tt>LibertySAMLToken</tt> profile, you must perform the manual configuration steps provided in this topic.</p>

<p><b>To configure support for the <tt>LibertySAMLToken</tt> profile:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the application server is running.</li>
<li>Start a new browser session and point at the following URL: <tt>http://<i>localhost-fqdn</i>:8080/amserver</tt><br>
If your server is not installed on port <tt>8080</tt>, replace <tt>8080</tt> in the URL above with the correct port number.</li>
<li>At the Login screen, use the following values to log in:<br>
User: <tt>amadmin</tt><br>
Password: <tt>admin123</tt> (this is the default password).</li>
<li>Click the Web Services tab and then, in the Web Services page, click the Discovery Service tab.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and in the Resource Offerings for Bootstrapping area, click the default Service Type, <tt>urn:liberty:disco:2003-08</tt>.<br>
The Edit Resource Offerings page opens.</li>
<li>Under Service Instance, in the Service Description area, select the checkbox next to the <tt>urn:liberty:security:2003-08:null:null</tt> entry and click the Delete button.<br>
The Service Description area now has no items.</li>
<li>In the Service Description area, click the New Description button.<br>
The New Security Mechanism ID page opens.</li>
<li>In the New Security Mechanism ID page, in the Available list, select <tt>urn:liberty:security:2005-02:null:X509</tt> and click OK.<br>
<b>Note:</b> If the system asks you for an End Point URL, you can use <tt>http://localhost:8080/amserver/Liberty/disco</tt>. If your server is not installed on port <tt>8080</tt>, replace <tt>8080</tt> with the correct port number.<br>
The Edit Resource Offering page opens and under Service Instance, in the Service Description area, there is now an entry labeled <tt>urn:liberty:security:2005-02:null:X509</tt>.</li>
<li>At the Edit Resource Offering page, click Save, then at the Discovery Service page, click Save.</li>
<li>In the upper navigation area, click Log Out.</li>
