<p><b>To enable the Liberty security mechanism for a web service provider:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, expand the project node for the project where your web service provider is defined.</li>
<li>Expand the <tt>Web&nbsp;Services</tt> node, right-click the <tt><i>web-service</i></tt> node, and choose Edit Web Service Attributes from the pop-up menu.<br>
The Web Service Attributes Editor opens with the Security tab open.</li>
<li>Select the Enable Message-Level Security checkbox.</li>

For the Liberty security mechanism, the web service provider must be registered with Access Manager's Discovery Service.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
<li>The certificate settings at the domain level for this token profile will apply for the server you selected. To change the global settings, follow the instructions in <a href="../am/config_am_sec_mech.html">Configuring Security Mechanisms for Sun Java System Access Manager Instances</a>.</li>
<li>For the Liberty security mechanism, if you want to use a custom keystore, you must perform the steps described in <a href="../am/config_liberty_customkeystore.html">Using a Custom Keystore for the Liberty Token Profile</a> before deploying or running the project.</li>
