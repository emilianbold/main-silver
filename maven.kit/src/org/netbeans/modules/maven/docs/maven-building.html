        <h2>Building a Maven Project</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>The Maven build lifecycle has defined phases with goals that are executed when building and distributing the project.
        When you execute a goal, Maven will also execute all the preceding goals in the build lifecycle.
        You can invoke phase goals and plugin goals by mapping the goals to IDE actions, or you can 
        create custom goals and invoke the goals individually.
        When you execute a goal, the Maven output with the plugin and goal identifiers are displayed in the Output window.</p>

        <p>When you want to generate distributable files for the project, such as JAR files or WAR files, you need to build the project.
        When you build a Maven project using the IDE's Build command, by default the IDE executes the plugin goals in the
        <tt>install</tt> phase of the Maven lifecycle (builds the project and adds the artifact to the local repository).</p>
        

        <ul class="note">
            <li>The IDE can automatically compile classes when you save them if you enable the Compile on Save option 
                in the Compile category of the project's Properties window.
                When Compile on Save is enabled you do not need to build the project or compile individual classes 
                to run or test the project in the IDE.
                The incrementally compiled files are stored in a cache in your user directory and are copied to your 
                project's build folder when you run or debug your project.
            <p>Compile on Save is enabled by default for WAR, EJB and EAR projects.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p><strong>To build a Maven project:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the project node in the Projects window.</li>
            <li>Choose Run &gt; Build Project (F11).
            <p>The IDE displays the Maven output and any compilation errors in the Output window.
            You can double-click any error to go to the location in the source code where the error occurred.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can modify the goals that are executed by the Build command and other IDE commands by
        <a href="maven_settings.html">modifying Maven settings</a> in the project's Properties window.</p>


        <p><strong>To build an individual project and its required projects:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build with Dependencies.
                <ul class="note">
                    <li>You can change the default Build action to Build with Dependencies by selecting the Build action
                        in the Actions category of the project's Properties window and then selecting the Build with Dependencies checkbox.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can modify the project dependencies by adding libraries in the Projects window or by editing
        <tt>pom.xml</tt> in the editor.</p>


        <h3>Executing Maven Goals in the IDE</h3>
        <p>IDE actions in the popup menu are mapped to Maven phases and goals.
        For example, by default the Build action in the IDE is mapped to the <tt>install</tt> phase in the Maven lifecycle.
        When you right-click the project node and choose Build, the IDE executes the goals described in the <tt>install</tt> phase to
        package the project and executes all the goals in the preceding phases in the build lifecycle.</p>

        <p>You can modify the mapped Maven goals that are invoked by IDE actions by configuring actions
        in the project's Properties window or in the Maven tab in the Options window.
        For more, see <a href="maven_settings.html">Configuring Maven settings</a>.</p>

        <h3>Customizing the Build Process</h3>
        <p>To customize the build for a Maven project you modify the POM to add or reconfigure plugins and dependencies.
        You can use the code completion in the editor to help you when adding details to <tt>pom.xml</tt>.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open <tt>pom.xml</tt> in the XML editor.</li>
            <li>Choose Source &gt; Insert Code (Ctrl-I) from the main menu and select Plugin from the popup menu
            to open the Add New Plugin dialog box.</li>
            <li>Type a query term to search for the plugin.</li>
            <li>Select the plugin from the list of available plugins.</li>
            <li>Select the goals that you want to be executed. Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you click OK, the IDE adds the plugin description to <tt>pom.xml</tt> and the goals to run as part of the build process.
        If you add a plugin that is not in the local repository, the required artifact will be automatically downloaded from a remote repository
        when required.
        </p>
