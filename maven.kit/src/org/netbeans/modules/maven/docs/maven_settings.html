<h2>Configuring Maven Settings</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>You can configure Maven settings at the IDE level and at the project level.
At the IDE level you can configure Maven installation and repository details and define global Maven goals.
At the project level you can create configurations to activate Maven profiles and
bind IDE actions to Maven goals for a project.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Maven Settings for the IDE</h3>
<p>You configure Maven settings that effect the
behavior of Maven in the IDE in the Options window.
In the Options window you can specify a local Maven installation,
the location of the local Maven repository and settings for updating the repository.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the main window, choose Tools &gt; Options. </li>
  <li>Click the Miscellaneous category and then click the Maven tab.</li>
  <li>Modify the properties as desired. Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring Maven Settings for Projects</h3>
<p>By using the project's Properties window you can configure Maven settings for an individual project.
You can create custom configurations and then bind IDE actions to Maven goals and assign the
binding to a configuration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties. </li>
  <li>Click the category in the left pane and modify the properties in the right pane. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Using Project Configurations</strong></p>
<p>The Configurations category of the Properties window of a Maven project enables you to create and select 
custom configurations for your project.
For example, you can create custom configurations to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Load the project in the IDE with a customized set of dependencies or submodules.</li>
    <li>Trigger actions and activate any associated profiles.</li>
    <li>Customize IDE actions to map to Maven goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a custom configuration for a project perform the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Configurations category of the Properties window by right-clicking
      the project node in the Projects window and choosing Set Configuration &gt; Customize.
  <p>Alternatively, right-click the project node and choose Properties and select Configurations
  in the Properties window.</p></li>
  <li>Click Add to open the Add Configuration dialog box.</li>
  <li>Type a name for the new configuration.</li>
  <li>Select Keep private to this IDE instance if you do not want to share the
  configuration with other instances of the IDE. 
  <p>By default this option is deselected and configurations are shared between
  instances of the IDE when the project is opened, for example when you open
  the project in an updated version of the IDE.</p></li>
  <li>Type any profiles or settings that you want to enable for the configuration.
  Click OK to close the Add Configuration dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the new configuration in the list of configurations and click Activate.
      <p>The name of the configuration that is currently active is in bold.</p></li>
  <li>Modify additional options for the configuration in the other
  categories in the Properties window. Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you click OK the IDE creates a configuration file in the root directory
    of the project with the name <tt>nbactions-<i>myconfigurationname</i>.xml</tt>.</p>
<p>To activate a configuration for a project, right-click the project node
    and choose Set Configuration and then choose the configuration name in the popup menu.
    You can also use the drop-down list in the toolbar to switch between configurations for the 
    project that is currently selected in the Projects window.
    If a project is set as the main project the dropdown list will display the configurations
    for the main project.</p>


<p><strong>Binding IDE Actions to Maven Goals</strong></p>

<p>You can use the Actions category in the Properties window to customize IDE actions by binding the action to Maven goals.
The Actions pane lists the IDE's default project actions that can be mapped to Maven goals.
You can assign the mapping to a project configuration if you activated configurations for the project.</p>
<p>After you select an IDE action you can modify the Maven goals and properties of the action by
typing in the textfield.
Actions are displayed in bold if the default values for the action have been modified.
The following textfields display the goals and properties associated with the selected action.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Execute Goals</strong> This field displays the Maven goals that are associated with
    the selected IDE action.</li>
    <li><strong>Activate Profiles</strong> This field displays any profiles that are activated when the action
    is invoked.</li>
    <li><strong>Set Properties</strong> This field displays the properties that are set on the command
    line. Properties are generally used to customize the behavior of the executed goal.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Creating Custom Actions</strong></p>
<p>You can create custom actions for a project by clicking Add Custom in the Actions category of the Properties window.
After you create the new action you can specify the goals or properties for the new action.
You can invoke the new action by right-clicking the project node in the Projects window and then choosing the
action under Custom in the popup menu.
</p>

<p>You can also create global custom goals for Maven projects by clicking Edit Global Custom Goal Definitions
in the Maven tab in the Options window.
The global goal is then listed in the popup menu under Custom when you right-click a Maven project in the Projects window.
